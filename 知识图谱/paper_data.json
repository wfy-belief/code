China and the United States have experienced the 3 stages of development in the field of network security: Mutual benefit and win-win stage (1994-1999), The Sino-US network relationship is roughly balanced. (1999-2010), The frequent occurrence of network security issues (2010-present). The conflicts and limited cooperation are intertwined with each other in China and the United States cyberspace security relations.\n\nThe cyberspace security issues in Sino-US bilateral relations are mainly reflected in the differences in Sino-US network sovereignty, cyber-hackers, cyber-espionage, and the United States' restrictions on trade with China on the grounds of cyberspace security.\n\nMaintaining and developing an open, stable and secure cyberspace is in the common interest of China and the United States. China should actively promote the integration of the two countries' cyberspace security concepts, interests and policies. On the one hand, it should promote consensus and establish mechanisms. On the other hand, the two sides should restrict cyber-attacks and network intelligence activities involving the other side to jointly respond to cyber threats; and promote pragmatic cooperation in the field of cyberspace security with a win-win concept.\n\n",

The Internet, as of today, proposes to connect everything driven by the semiconductor, naming it off late, as the Internet-of-Things (IoT). It has over the years, connected the semiconductor driven systems and their human users, evolving the connected whole including the human user represented in that common whole, being called the cyberspace. This cyberspace consists of all the computing, processing, storage, printing, communicating, networking, etc. devices together with the large mass of human population using it.",

These systems are represented as the complex of various interacting teams of intelligent agents. The agents can be in the state of antagonistic counteraction or cooperation. The general conceptual model of agent teams' antagonistic counteraction and cooperation is suggested. The task of developing the agent cyberworld, where agents realize the distributed attacks and defense, is investigated on the example of \"distributed denial of service\" attack subject domain. The architecture and implementation of research environment for agentoriented simulation is presented. The environment is implemented on the basis of discrete-event simulation system that allowed to combine the agent-oriented and network protocol based simulation.",

In this paper, we use the taylor expansions and the thought of infinite approximation to get the root of the cyberspace security-model equation. First, introduce the calculation formula of the new iterative method. Second, make the explanation of the new iterative method for root. Third, make a discussion about the convergence of the new iterative method for root. Forth, introduce the calculation steps of the new iterative method for root. The last but not the least, in order to let readers understand the new method, we wirte down some notes and problems during our design. © 2011 Published by Elsevier Ltd.",

These disadvantages lead to risks which exist in network security management applications and accordingly cause a loss. In this paper, we make use of the HoneyNet dataset and adopt statistic analysis to find the vulnerabilities of the services which the hosts provide in the network system. According to the network topology, the host layout and the relations among services, the paper presents a novel time-divided and hierarchical approach to achieve the current situation of network security. The approach can be applied to modeling security situation and achieve the expressions of the security situation of the network system. Coupled with the statistical data, the paper shows the simulation curves of the security situation in different periods through a great deal of calculation. The analysis of the simulation result proves the algorithm efficient and provides us for our future implementation with the academic foundation of the evaluation of the security situation. ©2006 IEEE.",

Corresponding strategies and a research architecture are proposed for common public networks (C space), secure classified networks (S space), and key infrastructure networks (K space), based on their individual characteristics. The features and security requirements of these networks are then discussed. Taking C space as an example, we introduce the SMCRC (which stands for “situation awareness, monitoring and management, cooperative defense, response and recovery, and countermeasures and traceback”) loop for constructing a cyberspace security ecosystem. Following a discussion on its characteristics and information exchange, our analysis focuses on the critical technologies of the SMCRC loop. To obtain more insight into national cyberspace security, special attention should be paid to global sensing and precise mapping, continuous detection and active management, cross-domain cooperation and systematic defense, autonomous response and rapid processing, and accurate traceback and countermeasure deterrence.",

However, according to the different view points and purpose, it is very difficult to give a wildly accepted result. Multi- perspective quantization model for cyberspace security situation awareness employ three perspectives, namely, threat oriented, essential oriented, and holistic, for evaluating and forecasting the security of network system. The aim is to try to ensure objectivity, and because it adopts multi-perspective parameters, the results can be used in various purposes of cyberspace security situation awareness. This model is suitable for all kinds of users, and it can help users get objective results.",

In this paper, the design and implementation of a fuzzy reasoning based cyberspace security awareness model is presented. The new feature of the this method is that it can give better perception and projection of cyberspace security situational. We show that this new method, referred to as machine learning situational awareness analyses, is efficient in situational perceiving, main contribution of this paper is to further integration of the fuzzy reasoning and situational risk control strategies to cyberspace security analysis.",

In the full paper, we discuss these two respects in detail; here we can only describe them in general terms. The workflow of the system designed by us consists of four steps; step 3 contains essential details of procedure not mentioned in Ref.1 and thus improves Ref.1 in one respect. The mathematics in designing the needed Kalman filter is given in much detail and we correct what we believe to be erroneous in the mathematics of Ref.1 and thus improve Ref.1 in another respect. By improving the Internet worm warning system, we can achieve early and accurate estimation by Kalman filter of the worm's infection rate, thus ensuring cyberspace security by preventing its quick propagation. Simulation results show that the system improved by us provides an effective way for Internet worm warning.",

Therefore, malware detection has become one of the important research topics in cyberspace security. At present, however, the practical teaching for malware detection mainly focuses on delivering the theory and skills, and actual combat training is relatively weak. As a novel method for malware recognition and analysis, software gene technology can quickly explore potential functional and behavioral information of malware, and detect unknown malware. Hence, building an experimental platform for malware gene analysis can effectively reduce the time required for students to quickly carry out the actual analysis process, support student needs for comprehensive data analysis, and provide a unified public service infrastructure for classroom teaching, practical training and scientific research.",

In the cloud computing environment, if the network isolation mechanism fails, malicious tenants will break the border and initiate illegal access, which will expose the cloud\\u0027s data assets and privacy to huge security risks. Based on the comparative analysis of this paper, the relevant concepts of cyberspace security are analysed, and the “3 + 2” research architecture of cyberspace security is proposed, and related security theories and method support technologies are discussed. On this basis, the key technologies involved are elaborated, and it is concluded that high-performance cloud computing provides important technical support for information security emergency systems with powerful data processing capabilities.",

Current studies focus mainly on how to acquire SSA data via a fusion information method, while a full understanding of existing SSA data has not been obtained. In this paper, complex network theory is introduced to model SSA data, and SSA state information is connected to the properties of the constructed network. Through analyzing the property quantities of the network, we can more effectively mine the characteristics of current data. A case study is conducted to demonstrate our method on a real traffic trace collected by an authority lab, and the test results verified that the property quantities of complex network can expose SSA messages about current state and future tendencies.",

Individual and crowd creatures develop various abilities that are highly effective and energy-efficient to improve their sustaining and well-being in dangerous and unpredictable environments. Learning from the natural world by adopting its useful principles and mechanisms, essential forms in bionics computing such as evolutionary computing, swarm intelligence or neuron network simulation could be applied to tackling cyberspace security threats that greatly jeopardize its desirable state of prosperity. Focused on different bionics computing models that receive most attention from security industry or academic practitioners, the dissertation briefly introduces the idea and intrinsic principles of bionics computing paradigm, reviews its technical maturity and typical applications, and gives envision of the possible development trends of bionics computing to build stronger cyberspace defense frontier.",

Network warfare is no longer a matter of talking on paper, but as a new combat style that can not only destroy enemy military command and control, intelligence information, and air defense military network systems, but also can quietly destroy, desecrate or even control the business of the other side. Civil affairs, government affairs, economic and trade, and other civil network systems have achieved the goal of fighting against the enemy without fighting. This paper studies and analyzes the development of the nine classic network warfare applications, and has important practical implications for shaping the safe and favorable cyberspace situation and advancing national cyberspace security.",

The international community\nis fully aware of the urgent need to secure the cyberspace as you see the\nmultiplication of security standards and national schemes interpreting them\nbeyond borders: ISO 15408, ISO 17799, and ISO 27001. Even though some\ncountries, including the Security Big Six (SB6), are equipped with their\nsecurity books and may feel relatively safe; this remains a wrong sense of\nsecurity as long as they share their networks with entities of less security.\nThe standards impose security best practices and system specifications for the\ndevelopment of information security management systems. Partners beyond borders\nhave to be secure as this is only possible if all entities connected to the\npartnership remain secure. Unfortunately, there is no way to verify the\ncontinuous security of partners without periodic security auditing and\ncertification, and members who do not comply should be barred from the\npartnership. This concept also applies to the cyber space or the electronic\nsociety. In order to clean our society from cyber crimes and cyber terrorism we\nneed to impose strict security policies and enforce them in a cooperative\nmanner. The paper discusses a country's effort in the development of a national\nsecurity strategy given its security economic intelligence position, its\nsecurity readiness, and its adverse exposure.",

On one hand the development of Internet, mobile communications, distributed computing, computer software and databases storing essential enterprise information has helped to conduct business and personal communication between individual people. On the other hand it has created many opportunities for abuse, fraud and expensive damage. This book is a selection of the best papers presented at the NATO Advanced Research Workshop dealing with the Subject of Cyberspace Security and Defense. The level of the individual contributions in the volume is advanced and suitable for senior and graduate students, researchers and technologists who wish to get some feeling of the state of the art in several sub-disciplines of Cyberspace security. Several papers provide a broad-brush description of national security issues and brief summaries of technology states. These papers can be read and appreciated by technically enlightened managers and executives who want to understand security issues and approaches to technical solutions. An important question of our times is not \"Should we do something for enhancing our digital assets security\", the question is \"How to do it\".",

Though traditional attack detecting methods designed based on feature matching algorithm can only analyze a single IP packet, the cannot comprehensively analyze multi-packets. Therefore, the traditional methods cannot effectively detect the attackers' payload that are split up into multi-packets. Consequently, it is quite necessary to reassemble packets on the application layer and restore the payload that is distributed in multiple packets. Then, we can analyze the complete attacker's payload flexibly. In this work, we propose a TCP session bidirectional data flow reassembly method based the Finite State Machine (FSM). Besides, we evaluate the performance of our work using the Spark platform. Simulation results show that our method is of high accuracy and good performance in expansibility.\n\n",

It is intended as both a teaching tool and reference. This broad-ranging text/reference comprehensively surveys computer network security concepts, methods, and practices and covers network security tools, policies, and administrative goals in an integrated manner. It is an essential security resource for undergraduate or graduate study, practitioners in networks, and professionals who develop and maintain secure computer network systems.",

The primary goal of the camp was to help teachers and students become better cyber-citizens who help rather than hinder security efforts by making them aware of the benefits and dangers of cyberspace. The residential camp exposes student participants to multiple topics of cyberspace including: history of cyberspace, ethical and social issues, applications, and the need for and use of security in cyberspace. Faculty members from the College of Engineering and Science teamed up with the College of Liberal Arts to develop a residential camp experience aimed at high school teachers and students. During the summer of 2008, 30 high school students and 10 teachers, from throughout the region participated in the summer camp. The camp consisted of discussion sessions, hands on engineering and computer science labs, a cryptographic treasure hunt, film sessions, and a final cyber challenge each of which integrated the history, ethical issues, applications, and theory behind cyberspace, security, and cryptography.",

During this century, the thought of seeking the system security to the source of system development lifecycle received huge improvement in the system and software assurance domain. This paper expounds the understanding of information security by illustrating information security study development progress since pre-computer age and presents a description of cyberspace and cyberization security by summarizing the status quo of cyberization. Then a security model called PDRL, which includes six core security attributes of sensitive information systems, is proposed to protect the security of sensitive information systems in the whole system life-cycle.",

This meshed network of geographically distributed control systems has recently been interlaced with network capable devices. This article manipulates power system state parameters to identify stealthy cyber-events based on the feature identification method principal component analysis. Principle component analysis is used to examine power system instances contained in an in-control set. To develop a set of observable power system instances the Newton-Rhapson method is used to solve the power flow equations. Cyber-events were created by changing the in-control instances of the power system parameters over a range of ±40%. If a changed instance, simulated malicious instance, was mapped via principle component analysis within close range of the average Hotelling's T2 value that instance was deemed stealthy. Results indicate certain features have a higher likelihood of remaining in the stealthy regions.",

At the epicenter of this contest is China--home to the world's largest Internet population and what is perhaps the world's most advanced Internet censorship and surveillance regime in cyberspace. Resistance to China's Internet controls comes from both grassroots activists and corporate giants such as Google. Meanwhile, similar struggles play out across the rest of the region, from India and Singapore to Thailand and Burma, although each national dynamic is unique. Access Contested, the third volume from the OpenNet Initiative (a collaborative partnership of the Citizen Lab at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs, the Berkman Center for Internet and Society at Harvard University, and the SecDev Group in Ottawa), examines the interplay of national security, social and ethnic identity, and resistance in Asian cyberspace, offering in-depth accounts of national struggles against Internet controls as well as updated country reports by ONI researchers. The contributors examine such topics as Internet censorship in Thailand, the Malaysian blogosphere, surveillance and censorship around gender and sexuality in Malaysia, Internet governance in China, corporate social responsibility and freedom of expression in South Korea and India, cyber attacks on independent Burmese media, and distributed-denial-of-service attacks and other digital control measures across Asia.",

Combining encryption with SQL operations is a promising approach although it is characterized by many open issues. Existing proposals, which are based on some trusted intermediate server, limit availability and scalability of original cloud database services. We propose an alternative architecture that avoids any intermediary component, thus achieving availability and scalability comparable to that of unencrypted cloud database services. Moreover, our proposal guarantees data consistency in scenarios in which independent clients concurrently execute SQL queries, and the structure of the database can be modified.",

Many of security mechanisms use dynamic taint analysis techniques for tracking information flow in software. But these techniques cannot detect control flows that use conditionals to implicitly transfer information from objects to other objects. In particular, malicious applications can bypass Android system and get privacy sensitive information through control flows. We propose an enhancement of dynamic taint analysis that propagates taint along control dependencies by using the static analysis in embedded system such as Google Android operating system. By using this new approach, it becomes possible to protect sensitive information and detect most types of software exploits without reporting too many false positives.",

Modern societies and militaries, both pervaded by computers, are supposedly at risk.

With short online lifetimes of those attacks, classical blacklist based approaches are not sufficient to protect online users. While attackers manage to achieve high similarity between original and fraudulent websites, this fact can also be used for attack detection. In many cases attackers try to make the Internet address (URL) from a website look similar to the original. In this work, we present a way of using the URL itself for automated detection of phishing websites by extracting and verifying different terms of a URL using search engine spelling recommendation. We evaluate our concept against a large test set of 8730 real phishing URLs. In addition, we collected scores for the visual quality of a subset of those attacks to be able to compare the performance of our tests for different attack qualities. Results suggest that our heuristics are able to mark 54.3% of the malicious URLs as suspicious. With increasing visual quality of the phishing websites, the number of URL characteristics that allow a detection increases, as well.",

However, the exposure of users to privacy invasion in the presence of DRM systems is problematic. We come up with a concept that unites software providers' and users' demands for a secure and privacy-preserving DRM system for cloud computing. The employment of proxy re-encryption allows for a prevention of profile building (under pseudonym) of users by any party.",

In particular, social media provides a means to create new marketing and distribution opportunities to a global marketplace, often exploiting jurisdictional gaps between buyer and seller. The sheer volume of postings presents investigational barriers, but the platform is amenable to the partial automation of open source intelligence. This paper presents a new methodology for automating social media data, and presents two pilot studies into its use for detecting marketing and distribution of illicit drugs targeted at Australians. Key technical challenges are identified, and the policy implications of the ease of access to illicit drugs are discussed.",

In this paper, we propose a secure DHCPv6 system that uses RSA authentication and Self-Certified Address to improve the access safety. By appending Certificate Option to DHCPv6 messages, the system guarantees the integrity of the messages. In addition, the system allocates addresses which can be verified by the address itself. With the benefits of Certificate Option and Self-Certified Address, the system prevents DHCPv6 from various network attack such as Man-in-Middle attack and Denial-of-Service attack. It also provides strict access control of the network by checking whether the address is obtained from the DHCPv6 server or not. We implement the system on dibbler which is an opensource DHCPv6 software and validate it in our campus network.",

However, most existing security engineering approaches focus on capturing and enforcing security requirements at design time. Many do not address how a system should be adapted to cope with new unanticipated security requirements that arise at runtime. We describe a new approach - Model Driven Security Engineering at Runtime (MDSE@R) - enabling security engineers to dynamically specify and enforce system security requirements based on current needs. We introduce a new domain-specific visual language to model customer security requirements in a given application. Moreover, we introduce a new UML profile to help capturing system architectural characteristics along with security specifications mapped to system entities. Our MDSE@R toolset supports refinement and merger of these visual models and uses model-driven engineering to take the merged model and specify security controls to be enforced on the target system components. A combination of interceptors (via generated configurations) and injected code (using aspect-oriented programming) are used to integrate the specified security controls within the target system. We describe MDSE@R, give an example of using it in securing an ERP system, describe its implementation, and discuss an evaluation of applying MDSE@R on a set of open source applications.",

The traditional Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDPS) are deemed largely inefficient to be deployed in cloud computing environments due to their openness, dynamicity and virtualization in offered services. This paper surveys and explores the possible solutions to detect and prevent intrusions in cloud computing systems by providing a comprehensive taxonomy of existing IDPS. It discusses the key features of IDPS that are challenging and crucial for choosing the right security measures for designing an IDPS. The paper further reviews the current state of the art of developed IDPSs for cloud computing which uses advanced techniques in overcoming the challenges imposed by cloud computing requirements for more resilient, effective and efficient IDPSs, abbreviated as CIPDS.",

For a traditional supervised learning algorithm, training examples with ground-truth labels should be given in advance. However, in real applications, the number of labeled examples is limited whereas a lot of unlabeled data is widely available, because labeling data requires a large amount of human efforts and is thus very expensive. To mitigate this issue, several semi-supervised learning algorithms, which aim to label data automatically without human intervention, have been proposed to utilize unlabeled data in improving the performance of IDSs. In this paper, we attempt to apply disagreement-based semi-supervised learning algorithm to anomaly detection. Based on our previous work, we further apply this approach to constructing a false alarm filter and investigate its performance of alarm reduction in a network environment. The experimental results show that the disagreement-based scheme is very effective in detecting intrusions and reducing false alarms by automatically labeling unlabeled data, and that its performance can further be improved by co-working with active learning.",

Content sharing service will grow dramatically with the convenience of consuming cloud resources. But the traditional security threats toward content sharing systems are still not solved. Malicious adversaries can inject a massive number of spam, advertisements, or even viruses into the content sharing systems. Traditional voting based online content ranking and reputation system cannot solve this problem effectively due to Sybil attack and collusive attack. In this paper, with the help of a user-defined trust network, we develop a novel deceiving resistant content rating framework to mitigate pollution attack in content sharing system. The simulation result shows that our system is efficient to aggregate votes from honest peers and is effective to filter out bogus votes from tricky collusive deceivers.",

We introduce a new construction of ensemble classifiers, based on the well known and productive multi-tier approach. Our experiments evaluate their performance for the detection and filtering of phishing emails. The multi-tier constructions are well known and have been used to design effective classifiers for email classification and other applications previously. We investigate new multi-tier ensemble classifiers, where diverse ensemble methods are combined in a unified system by incorporating different ensembles at a lower tier as an integral part of another ensemble at the top tier. Our novel contribution is to investigate the possibility and effectiveness of combining diverse ensemble methods into one large multi-tier ensemble for the example of detection and filtering of phishing emails. Our study handled a few essential ensemble methods and more recent approaches incorporated into a combined multi-tier ensemble classifier. The results show that new large multi-tier ensemble classifiers achieved better performance compared with the outcomes of the base classifiers and ensemble classifiers incorporated in the multi-tier system. This demonstrates that the new method of combining diverse ensembles into one unified multi-tier ensemble can be applied to increase the performance of classifiers if diverse ensembles are incorporated in the system.",

In this paper, we propose an integrated Android malware detection scheme, combining permission and behavior analysis. For APK files which had been detected, their MD5 values are extracted as signature for detection. For APK files which had not been detected, detection is carried based on permission and behavior analysis. Behavior analysis contained taint propagation analysis and semantic analysis. Experiment results show that this system can detect the malware of privacy stealing and malicious deduction successfully.",

To design middleware architectures, developers often employ architectural patterns --- solutions to recurring software problems. In general these patterns do not contain any security features, however, it is possible to make secured versions of them using experience or by considering security threats and countermeasures in real-life implementations. Using this inductive approach we have built up a catalog of such (compound security) patterns for middleware. They can be used by developers early in the software development life-cycle to efficiently determine a set of relevant security requirements. In this paper we continue the same line of work to secure the Wrapper Façade and Distributed Publish/Subscribe patterns, extending the inductive approach from before with a deductive approach based on a use-case driven threat analysis. We document the resulting Secure Façade compound pattern briefly, and the Secure Publish/Subscribe in more detail.",

Given that Augmented Reality presentations enable the more creation ways of user interactions that expand traditional HCI from 2D to 3D spaces, this offer an ideal opportunity for game developers to design more playful and interesting AR games that embed various interaction forms. In this paper, we build an augmented reality game creative platform, which allows game developers to integrate augmented reality features,spatial human computer interaction mechanism and other advanced interaction techniques into the designed game.In this system, we implement a adopted augmented reality function to help the developers to directly superimpose the visual 3d objects over the live real video image and then port human motion interactive trigger module to this system based on kinect, in which a up-down hierarchy figure description algorithm is proposed to build a common virtual 3d human model prototype that could allow developer ignore the difference of various players' shape and make the players easily to use their actions to interact with the 3d virtual objects to get more unique game experience.",

However, establishing a secure m-commerce platform that offers high level of service can be challenging. This paper proposes a concept of m-identity targeted at control the access of involved parties in an m-commerce transaction. M-identity includes both identities of a user and his/her bound mobile device which is defined as a user's biometric feature(s) taken by his/her bound mobile camera. As an additional factor of authentication, a watermark is embedded in the captured biometric images. The embedding key of the watermark is a shared secret between mobile device and central server. Then an m-identity authentication (MA) protocol is proposed. M-identity merges mobile device identity into biometrics images. Only the genuine owner whose biometric information captured by his/her bound mobile device can pass m-identity authentication. Combined with the watermark, this makes a 2 ½ factor authentication process. Fingerprint biometrics taken with the mobile camera is used as an example to show how MA protocol works.",

Dedicated anonymous networks such as Freenet and I2P allow anonymous file-sharing among users. However, one major problem with anonymous file-sharing networks is that the available content is highly reduced, mostly with outdated files, and non-anonymous networks, such as the BitTorrent network, are still the major source of content: we show that in a 30-days period, 21648 new torrents were introduced in the BitTorrent community, whilst only 236 were introduced in the anonymous I2P network, for four different categories of content. Therefore, how can a user of these anonymous networks access this varied and non-anonymous content without compromising its anonymity? In this paper, we improve content availability in an anonymous environment by proposing the first internetwork model allowing anonymous users to access and share content in large public communities while remaining anonymous. We show that our approach can efficiently interconnect I2P users and public BitTorrent swarms without affecting their anonymity nor their performance. Our model is fully implemented and freely usable.",

Institutions such as Citibank and Ebay have faced intrusions that have cost them millions of dollars in damages. With the onset of these criminal attacks, there is an increase in demand for products and services that provide more information for people. Tangled Web: Tales of Digital Crime from the Shadows of Cyberspace portrays the shadow side of cyberspace by taking you into the lairs of hackers, crackers, researchers, private investigators, law enforcement agents and intelligence officers. The book covers what kinds of cyber-crimes are going to affect business on the Internet, their cost, how they are investigated, and the motivation of hackers and virus writers. Also covered are the problems faced by law enforcement, corporate cyber security professionals, and real-world examples of cyber crimes and lessons learned.",

One of the notable applications of location based service (LBS) is precision marketing which has displayed its attractiveness all over the world. The core of LBS is real-time and precise positioning technology. Positioning by mobile terminals and positioning by base stations are two major solutions. GPS or base station cell numbers are used in mobile terminal positioning. This positioning technology requests users to forward location information actively and an extra fee relating to internet traffic has to been paid. Also, the coverage of this positioning technology is quite limited. Positioning by base stations utilize the signalling analysis platform to acquire the location of users. Low accuracy of positioning and poor real-time performance are two main shortcomings of this positioning technology. The system we design can acquire the equipment information of mobile phones without the perception of the users. Software radio technology and independent devices are used in positioning for better performance. Equipment information and location information is collected in gateway and forwarded to application platform to provide real-time services to users. Wide coverage, high accuracy of positioning and good real-time performance are notable advantages of this system.",

This method could be used to simplify establishment of fuzzy matrices and then fix weight of all kinds of faults of different equipment that may affect entire grid. Adopting the method of fuzzy comprehensive evaluation to evaluate the fault happened in distribution network, which could do tradeoff analysis for each affected factors, solving the problem of serious distortion or multiple peak values result from many factors then small weight for each factors. In this way, the evaluation criteria will satisfy the practice demand of the project. Thus, the effectiveness of the proposed method in diagnosing fault types of distribution network was verified by experimental results.",

This new approach enables secure meter data handling within the smart grid. As a result, our architecture preserves the privacy of sensitive consumer data and the integrity of meter data. Additionally, our proposed solution enhances the security of components critical to the operation of the power grid.",

Now the cost could be anything ranging from your privacy, security, finance or simply \"YOU\". A Smartphoneos knowledge of its user, if not protected, is a potential risk to the very user's security and privacy. When a smartphone is stolen, it isn't just the device you need to worry about but the treasure of private and sensitive data it holds, which can compromise your very safety and privacy if in the wrong hands. A determined adversary can potentially uncover a lot of things from a stolen iOS device -- credit card numbers, passwords of various other accounts, bank account numbers, etc. On top of that, if it's a work phone, the adversary can also gain entry into your company's restricted network, which is otherwise highly secure and private. In this paper we propose a simple yet powerful method of protecting the loss of private and sensitive data resident on a stolen iOS devices, focusing mainly on iPhones. SafeCode security mechanism leverages on existing passcode protection mechanism on iOS devices to prevent the device from being \"switched off\" or \"silenced\" by the adversary when the device is stolen. SafeCode, in the best case scenario, extends the \"window of opportunity\" of recovering the stolen device. In the worst case scenario, SafeCode augments the probability of remotely wiping the device with the same extended \"window of opportunity\".",

In this paper we discuss the shortcomings of existing approaches to the administration of physical access control in complex environments. At the heart of the problem is the current dependency on human administrators to reason about the implications of the provision or the revocation of staff access to an area within these facilities. We demonstrate how utilising Building Information Models (BIMs) and the capabilities they provide, including 3D representation of a facility and path-finding, may reduce the incidents of errors made by security administrators.",

In this paper we suggest machine learning algorithms that can assist in supporting the security function effectively and present a framework that can be used to choose the best algorithm for a specific domain. A qualitative framework was produced, and it is suggested that a naive Bayesian classifier and artificial neural network based algorithms are most likely the best candidates for the proposed application. A testing framework is proposed to conduct a quantitative evaluation of the algorithms as the next step in the determination of best fit for purpose algorithm. Future research will look to repeat this process for cyber security specific applications, and also examine GPGPU optimisations.",

Frequent Smart Meter readings can, e.g., reveal sensitive details about a customer's behaviour and preferences. The Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) concept explores using electric vehicles as a centrally coordinated grid resource in a Smart Grid. It can similarly lead to privacy issues by revealing a customer's whereabouts. Though these two privacy issues are closely related, until now, there exists no common architectural approach to protect privacy. In this work, we critically analyse the Smart Grid infrastructure mandated by German law and its shortcomings regarding V2G privacy. Based on this, we propose V2GPriv an architecture that demonstrates how the V2G concept can be integrated with a Smart Grid infrastructure to offer both privacy benefits and avoid costs of a separate V2G infrastructure.",

But there are some problems, school administrators and teachers are only to focus on the individual development of multimedia teaching, who are ignoring the multimedia technology as a whole to promote the development of education. The quality of multimedia are determined by multimedia data access model, which will determine the effectiveness of teaching. In this paper, which is by building multimedia data access model to improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of multimedia teaching.",

Recursive Gauss-Newton (RGN) algorithm is introduced to solve the time delay estimation model given in [1], rather than LMS. The proposed algorithm is termed RGNADES, which combines the convergence rate advantages of RGN and filtering advantages of ADES. Simulation results show that the proposed methods greatly improve the convergence rate as well as stability in traditional ADES using LMS method.",

An attacker called botmaster controls it and a botnet invokes an attack such as scanning and DDoS attack. In this paper, we use the 3D-visualization to investigate the change of attack according to the darknet traffic. As a result, we discover the attack in which several source IP addresses transmit packets to a single destination within a short period of time. In addition, we find that the packet size and the destination port number are identical on its attack. Furthermore, we propose the method to detect this attack called behavior of collaborative attack. In our proposal, we focus on the number of source IP addresses which transmit packets to the single destination. We detected this packet and the rate of packet with the same packet size and destination port number occupied about 90% of the set unit of extracted packet.",

With an unique fingerprint being imperceptibly embedded in each authorized copy of the object, in case a pirate copy is found, by analysing the fingerprint in the observed pirate copy, the distributer can identify the users who produced the pirate copy. Collusion-secure fingerprinting schemes address the problem of collusion, where a group of users (a coalition) detect and change the fingerprint symbols in their copies before producing pirate copies. It has been proved that there exist collusion-secure fingerprinting schemes that can identify at least one member of the coalition for any reasonably sized coalition. In order to guarantee the quality of the object, short fingerprinting codes are preferred in practical applications. A lower bound on the code length has been derived by Peikert et al, that is, any collusion-secure fingerprinting codes must have length at least o(s2log(1/sε)), where s is the size of coalition. Codes which achieve the lower bound are called optimal codes. However, currently known optimal codes do not have any efficient (polynomial time-complexity) tracing procedure to identify the coalition. The best known codes with efficient tracing algorithms, which were constructed by Cortrina-Navau and Fernández in 2010, have length O(s6log(s/ε)log(N)), where N is the total number of authorized users. In this paper, we construct a class of codes which have an efficient tracing algorithm and have length O(s2log(1/ε)log(N)). Our codes are much shorter than those by Cortrina-Navau and Fernández.",

These third-party marketplaces usually provide thousands of applications, but can't guarantee their security. Among the malicious applications, repackaging is one of the most common techniques to piggyback malicious payloads into legitimate applications. In order to keep the android ecosystem healthy, an app similarity measurement system is proposed to detect repackaged applications directly from the DEX file. We use the string length as the fingerprint to measure the similarity between third-party application and the original one, afterwards according to the similarity score whether one third-party application is repackaged or not can be determined. We perform a systematic study on five popular Android-based third-party marketplaces with randomly 200 samples from each third-party marketplace. Further manual investigation shows that these repackaged apps are mainly used to replace existing in-app advertisements or embed new ones to “steal” or re-route ad revenues. We also identify a few cases with planted malicious payloads among repackaged apps.",

However, malicious nodes may refuse to cooperate by intentionally dropping packets in order to disrupt the integrity of network services. In this paper, we introduce a distributed and cooperative approach for detection of packet dropping attacks. Intrusion detectors are individually placed at each node to passively monitor the node behavior and exchange routing events and detection results with neighboring nodes. Based on the exchanged events, each node is able to instantly detect malicious behavior on the own node's communication link or in the neighborhood. A virtualized mesh network environment composed of virtual machines is used to implement the distributed detection approach and demonstrate its effectiveness and reliability for detecting packet dropping attacks in the mesh network.",

It first uses static analysis techniques to identify and locate those interactive or input points and sensitive behavior functions. Then based on the distributed platform, by combining symbolic execution and concrete dynamic execution together and taking malware sensitive behaviors as the leading target, the parallel target-directed algorithm of searching sensitive paths and the method of leading and approaching sensitive behaviors are designed. It leads to traverse the sensitive functions, obtain the sensitive paths which can reach the sensitive behavior areas by path backtracking, and generate the corresponding test data. Finally, it finishes the analysis and test of malware behaviors. Experiments show that, compared with fuzz and full paths covering and traversing technique, this method can generate test data more efficiently, reduce the number of paths to be analyzed, and improve the analysis speed and efficiency of malware behaviors.",

In this paper, we introduce the basic knowledge and characteristic of COPE, and propose a multi-channel multiinterface wireless network coding algorithm based on guesswork (GUESS-MCMI-COPE). By reducing the space of reception reports and implementing multi-channel multiinterface, GUESS-MCMI-COPE can increase network throughput. We evaluate our design on NS2, and discuss the results. The results show that the performance of GUESSMCMI-COPE is superior to that of COPE.",

Due to the limited resources and node energy in WSN platforms, we must tailor the security mechanisms based on the characteristics of WSN. We present a analysis on classification on five layers of available mechanisms for DoS defense. These defense mechanisms are used to prevent, detect, response and tolerate the DoS attacks. This paper provides better understanding of the DoS attack problem and enables a security administrator to combat and mitigate the DoS threat.",

In this paper, we propose an online tracking algorithm with kernel sparse representation, local image patches of a target are represented by their sparse codes schemes with an over-complete dictionary, and online classifier is learned to discriminate the target. To improve robustness of the algorithm and the performance of the classifier, kernel function is applied on the sparse representation. In addition to, we propose a simple yet effective method for dictionary update. Experiments on challenging image sequences show that the proposed algorithm performs favorably against several state-of-the-art methods.",

First, we choose 4 most representative 1920x1080 progressive sequences depending on the TI and SI of them. Then, we process these sequences into 5 kinds of resolution and encode these sequences to 6 kinds of bit-per-pixel. Next we calculate SSIM between damaged sequence and original sequence. Finally, according to the relationship between SSIM and MOS, we propose a model that reflects the relationship between bit-per-pixel, resolution, and video quality. The model in this paper shows that when the resolution is unchanged, video quality rises as BPP increased; when the BPP is unchanged, video quality rises as the resolution increased.",

In view of the current IVOA framework and web service implementation are too complex, astronomers cannot quickly master them. Astronomical web service construction template by simple customization can realize fast simplified construction to meet the needs of the construction of virtual observatory. Simple Cone Search Protocol (SCS) provides an interface for searching catalogs by sky position. In this paper, we have a study on the quickly customized web service construction technology by using software engineering theory and code generation technology, and discuss the critical techniques of the system implementation. Finally, we present a system for fast data publishing, which named C-FDP, to realize the automatic customized query based on SCS. C-FDP packages for the current astronomical service construction technical details, and gets out the web service construction template which can meet the need of data publishing in the greatest degree.",

A timeline and beacon reference point model is presented, to establish synchronous beacon reference point in the base station channel. When the synchronous signal is decomposed by the quantum wavelet transform in the receiving end, the beacon signal of clock synchronization is detected, so the extract precise carrier phase information could be calculated. By this way, the synchronization precision of the communication system is enhanced. Finally, the simulation results of the clock synchronization model based on quantum wavelet beacon are, clock synchronization detection probability is 98.15%, and the clock synchronization precision is 4.579ns. The Matlab simulation verified that the clock synchronization model based on quantum wavelet beacon is reliable and feasible.",

The paper presents a three-dimension localization algorithm for mobile node wireless sensor network based on Monte Carlo method named MDBMCL. The main contribution of the paper is that the enhanced Monte Carlo localization algorithm is proposed. The algorithm uses the motor direction to prune the anchor box, and the sample and filter is more efficient. According to the result, the method has better performance than traditional Monte Carlo algorithm and Monte Carlo Boxed method in the node localization accuracy and arithmetic speed, and it can provide availability and exact location data for wireless sensor network.",

Our research indicates that security of the earlier version is weak, and subsequent 3.0 version provides more secure cryptographic algorithm. However, in order to acquire the compatibility, the forum software retains the weak algorithm which brings the potential security threat. According to this vulnerability, we design the corresponding attack while we also propose the countermeasures.",

In this paper, we proposed a no reference estimation of the coding PSNR for 4K-UHD videos in the compressed domain. As video coding parameters which can reflect the degree of distortion caused by compression can be extracted in compressed domain, we firstly extracted some feature parameters from 4k-UHD compressed videos. Then the parameters were applied to train the proposed model with the corresponding PSNR using multi-linear algorithm. After the training process, estimated PSNR can be acquired using the trained model. The experimental results show that our model can achieve a good performance for the 4K-UHD video streams with the corresponding PSNR.",

It not only needs the support of high-performance computing platform, but also needs a software technology to solve the complexities, and to enhance its flexibility and scalability. CBSE (component-based software engineering) technology is a good solution. But the existing widely used component technology in enterprise applications, such as CORBA/CCM, COM/COM+, J2EE/EJB, and .NET, does not suitable for largescale scientific computing field. The U.S. Department of Energy in conjunction with the Indiana University and the University of Utah recently proposed a component technology CCA (Common Component Architecture) for large-scale scientific computing field. This paper first analyzes CCA and verifies it's feasibility, and then introduces the CBSE into large-scale Geophysical applications using CCA, so as to solve the complexity of modeling, simulation, management and maintenance of the simulation of Geophysical Applications.",

Hazard assessment of debris flow aims to decide the hazard level of debris flow by analysing some impact factors. It is a critical step for forecasting the occurrence of debris flow disaster. In this paper, we propose a novel method, employing rough sets and Dempster-Shafer theory, to analyse the impact factors of debris flows. We first detailed the procedure, and then the samples of 37 debris flow gullies in Yunnan were utilized to evaluate the method. The result suggests that the method is effective and reliable.",

The presented approach is the first to consider authentication of public APs. It is also the first work to consider using digital Certificates for public AP authentication. Normally, when a user wants to access internet in public hot-spots like airports, coffee shops, library, etc., there is often lack of information for the user to make an informed decision on which AP to connect. Consequently, an adversary can easily place a rogue AP in a public hotspot luring users to connect to his AP. Unfortunately, most people focus their attention to the signal strength of the AP and the service fee, and very little attention to the security of the AP. This makes the job of the adversary significantly easier. The adversary can simply place a rogue AP with a look alike name (SSID) that is free to users. With the proposed Certificate-based authentication of APs, the user can readily see available certified APs in range and choose to connect to the one they prefer based on any parameter of choice --- signal strength, service provider, fees, etc. Finally, we have shown that an adversary can neither generate fake Certificates nor steal the Certificate from a certified AP and cause significant damage. We have also addressed defense against most common threats to public APs such as --- replay attacks, man-in-the-middle attacks, and fabrication attacks. The proposed solution is very robust in validating the authenticity of public APs and isolating rogue APs.",

Or, a user is given a private key assigned simultaneously for both a set of objective attributes and a subjective access policy. A major problem of the above DP-ABE scheme is the ciphertext size linear to the number of attributes while the LSSS access structure can be assumed. We propose two novel DP-ABEs, which achieve constant-size ciphertext, regardless of the number of attributes in a logical AND data access policy with wildcards. We present two constructions: the first scheme under the q-Bilinear Diffie Hellman Exponent (q-BDHE) and the second scheme under the Decisional Bilinear-Diffie-Hellman assumptions (DBDH).",

To offer enhanced security, features in the recent mobile IP protocols rely on the use of IP Security (IPSec) Security Association (SA). However, the SA itself will cease to be valid if a mobile node moves or a network moves. This paper proposes secure mobile IP (SecMIP) scheme based on one-time transaction key agreements instead of using the pre-generated IPsec SA. In the proposed scheme, the mobile node is responsible for relaying its blind key information from the Home Agent (HA) to the Foreign Agent (FA) while the relating secret value is securely kept in its HA. Receiving the Binding Update (BU) message that contains the FA's blind key, the HA can calculate the same transaction key as the FA. We analyze the time required for the enemy to succeed to attack our SecMIP scheme on integrity and authentication. Based on the analysis results, we suggest the optimum use of the operational parameters in our SecMIP scheme relating to the length of the secret value and the length of the prime number q in digit. The derived dimensions can guarantee an average of 1 year required for exhaustive key searching by brute force approaches while maintaining a maximum addition of 200 millisecond time latency for the HA and the FA to process the secured BU message.",

This is typically achieved through the formation of targeted Virtual Organisations (VO). Inter-organisational collaborations also bring challenges of security that must be overcome. There has been much work in e-Research-oriented security, i.e. at the middleware level, but far less on ensuring that middleware-oriented security is not made redundant through ensuring the robustness of the underlying hardware and software (fabric) upon which the e-Research middleware security is based, e.g. the operating systems, network configurations and core software required to support e-Research solutions. To tackle this, an integrated security framework is needed that is cognisant of VO requirements on e-Research middleware-oriented security and incorporates targeted fabric level security. In this paper we present an integrated architecture (ACVAS), which encompasses VO-specific fabric security including configuration-aware security monitoring (patch status monitoring) and vulnerability scanning and subsequent updating. We show how tool support can be used to pre-emptively identify and assess potential vulnerabilities in a VO, before they are potential exploited. We also outline how these vulnerabilities can be dynamically overcome to support the needs of the VO and associated e-Infrastructure to improve the overall VO security.",

One of these functions is the emulation of a contact less card, which enables the smartphone to realize commercial transactions (e.g. Payment, loyalty and ticketing) through NFC enabled Point of Sale (POS). Initially, the card emulation related services were uniquely hosted on a secure element, e.g., SIM, and thus, their protection against security threats is ensured. Recently, Android proposed the Host-based Card Emulation (HCE) that enables an ordinary application to emulate a contact less card. Hence, the complexity and outlay of emulating a contact less card are reduced. In this paper, we clarify the concept of HCE, and present its history and current utilizations. We further compare HCE with SE-based card emulation in terms of security and development issues. Finally, we discuss the impact of HCE on the ecosystem of the NFC-enabled services.",

When designing such systems, hypothesis testing via computational modelling and simulation is vital in order to reduce the need of costly wet lab experiments. As a case study, we discuss the use of computational modelling and stochastic simulation for engineered genetic circuits that implement Boolean AND and OR gates that have been reported in the literature. We present performance analysis results for nine different state-of-the-art stochastic simulation algorithms and analyse the dynamic behaviour of the proposed gates. Stochastic simulations verify the desired functioning of the proposed gate designs.",

A variety of SpMV GPU kernels using different matrix storage formats have been developed to accelerate these applications. Unlike SpMV, where matrix elements are accessed only once, multiplying by k vectors requires accessing matrix elements k times. In this paper we explore the design of efficient GPU SpMM kernels that exploit two common matrix sparsity patterns, diagonal matrices and matrices with uniform row lengths. Our kernels use GPU registers to exploit the potential data reuse in SpMM. For evaluating the performance of our SpMM kernels we use 28 structured matrices and 29 matrices with uniform row lengths. Executing on the NVIDIAs Kepler-based Tesla K20 GPU and for structured grid matrices, the average speedup over the best performing state of the art SpMV kernel including NVIDIA's kernels is 2.3x and the maximum is 4.6x. For unstructured mesh matrices, the average speedup is 2.6x and the maximum is 4.1x. Compared to NVIDIA's cuSPARSE SpMM kernel the average speedup is 1.8x and the maximum is 2.4x for structured grid matrices. For unstructured mesh matrices, the average speedup is 1.5x and the maximum is 2.6x.",

                    "abstract": "There is a constant increase in the interest shown for trusted computing in the embedded domain. In an MPSoC each processing element such as a CPU could request accessing any physical resource of the device such as a memory or an I/O component. Along with normal requests, malevolent ones could occur produced by malware applications or processes running in one or more CPUs. A protection mechanism is required to prevent injection of malicious data across the device, e.g. Unsafe data written by a CPU into a memory address, which are read later by another CPU. A considerable amount of research has been devoted in security for MPSoCs, but limited work exists in performing protection at the source instead of the target, thus cutting-off malicious content at an early stage prior to entering the on-chip network. In the present work we focus on the side of the CPU connected to the SoC network. We are envisioning a self-contained NoC firewall, which by checking the physical address of a request to a memory-mapped device against a set of rules, rejects untrusted CPU requests to the on-chip memory, thus protecting all legitimate applications running in a shared-memory SoC. To sustain high-performance we implemented the firewall in hardware, while rule-checking is performed at segment-level based on deny rules. To evaluate the impact of security mechanisms we developed a novel framework based on gem5, coupling ARM technology and an instance of a commercial point-to-point interconnect from STMicroelectronics called Spider on STNoC. Tests include several scenarios with legitimate and malicious processes running in different CPUs requesting access to shared memory. Preliminary results show that the incorporation of a security mechanism in the network interface can have a positive effect on network performance by reducing both the end-to-end delivery time of packets, and the power consumed from unnecessary transmissions. From the network aspect, this effect is independent of the pe- formance of implementation itself, e.g. Either a hardware or a software solution equally relieves the network from unnecessary loads. Finally, we compare the performance of our hardware approach over a simple equivalent software solution. Certainly, this comparison favours hardware by considerable margins, however we use it only as reference to illustrate the merit from implementing protection in hardware. The purpose of the present study is three-fold. First, we present the proposed hardware NoC firewall. Then we examine the effect on network transmissions from incorporating a security mechanism in the network interface, to do this we developed a novel framework. Finally, we include preliminary performance results of our NoC firewall and a simple yet indicative comparison with a software solution.",

While this isvery convenient, it requires the public exposure of the offeringand requesting identities along with information about the offeredand requested services, even when services do not need to bepublic. Some of the information published by the announcementscan be very revealing, including complete lists of family members.Another problem is the huge amount of multicast traffic caused,which is especially relevant for large WiFi networks.In this paper we present a privacy extension that does notpublish private information and reduces the number of packetssent while still not requiring any network configuration except foran initial pairing per pair of users. A key feature of our solutionis the ease of upgrading existing systems, a must for widespreaddeployment and acceptance.

Although keeping multiple copies of data is necessary to guarantee their availability and long term durability, in many situations the amount of data redundancy is immoderate. By keeping a single copy of repeated data, data deduplication is considered as one of the most promising solutions to reduce the storage costs, and improve users experience by saving network bandwidth and reducing backup time. However, this solution must now solve many security issues to be completely satisfying. In this paper we target the attacks from malicious clients that are based on the manipulation of data identifiers and those based on backup time and network traffic observation. We present a deduplication scheme mixing an intraand an inter-user deduplication in order to build a storage system that is secure against the aforementioned type of attacks by controlling the correspondence between files and their identifiers, and making the inter-user deduplication unnoticeable to clients using deduplication proxies. Our method provides global storage space savings, per-client bandwidth network savings between clients and deduplication proxies, and global network bandwidth savings between deduplication proxies and the storage server. The evaluation of our solution compared to a classic system shows that the overhead introduced by our scheme is mostly due to data encryption which is necessary to ensure confidentiality.",

It connects quadratic programming algorithms with FETI domain decomposition methods that bring high parallel scalability and at the same time high accuracy and robustness needed in engineering applications. According to its name, FLLOP forms an extension of the renowned PETSc software framework for parallel numerical solution of partial differential equations. It can be thus adopted by PETSc users with relative ease. The above-mentioned facts makes FLLOP a unique project. It now forms a solver part of our emerging PERMON toolbox for Parallel, Efficient, Robust, Modular, Object-oriented, Numerical simulations. We introduce one more PERMON tool, Permon Cube, which serves as a benchmark generation tool for FLLOP in massively parallel environment.",

Running scientific experiments in the cloud has its advantages such as elasticity, scalability and software maintenance. However, the communication latencies added by the virtualization, the technology behind the cloud's service provisioning in general, is observed to be the major hindrance for migrating scientific computing applications to the cloud. The problem escalates further when we consider scientific workflows, where significant data is exchanged across different tasks. So to migrate scientific workflows to the cloud, we propose a way to reduce the data communication by partitioning and scheduling the workflow and adapting a peer-to-peer data sharing among the nodes. Different size Montage workflows were considered for the analysis of the approach. From the study, we observed that the partitioning along with the peer-to-peer file sharing reduced the data communication in cloud up to 80%.",

The reasons are manifold and actively investigated in the community. Software monitors are essential for these studies as they provide the raw performance data to be analyzed. We propose an online monitoring workflow for event-based performance analysis that takes into account the significant changes in system architecture towards the development of exascale supercomputers. Critical properties are: communication across large numbers of processing elements, limited I/O capabilities, and a decreasing memory-per-core ratio. We present a hierarchical data management and steering workflow that directly couples the application, measurement, and analysis processes, thus eliminating the need for extensive communication and buffering. The workflow is closely integrated with the native system communication API to enable best communication across processing elements. The memory issue is addressed with a new lossy hierarchical data compression technique for in-memory storage, intended for small, fixed-size buffers. Further, we abandon secondary storage to avoid potential I/O challenges. We demonstrate the feasibility of our design with a prototype implementation that features services for data collection, analysis, and runtime compression. Our evaluation extrapolates results obtained with the NAS Parallel Benchmarks at up to 2,048 processes to an exascale workflow.",

Depending on the number of routing options available for each packet, routing algorithms are classified into two different categories: deterministic (one available path) and adaptive (several ones). It is well-known that adaptive routing outperforms deterministic routing. Usually, adaptive routing uses virtual channels to provide routing flexibility and to guarantee deadlock freedom. On the other hand, deterministic routing is simpler and therefore has lower routing delay and does not introduce out-of-order packet delivery. This is why, in this paper, we take the challenge of developing new routing algorithms for direct topologies that exploit virtual channels in an efficient way while still maintaining the good properties of deterministic routing. This is accomplished by tackling one of the main performance degradation contributors of interconnection networks, which is the HoL-blocking effect. To do that, this paper analyzes several simple mechanisms to perform an efficient distribution of packets among virtual channels based on their destination. The resulting deterministic routing mechanisms obtain similar or even better performance than adaptive routing while keeping the simplicity of deterministic routing and guaranteeing in-order delivery of packets by design.",

CES enabled networks assure policy based reach ability of hosts in private realms, without requiring keep-alive signaling. CES aims at improving security in the Internet by balancing the interests of the receiver with the interests of the sender, unlike the traditional best effort Internet that solely attends to the interests of the sender. The architecture substantially helps with the scalability limitations of IPv4 due to the generalization of private addressing of the hosts. This paper relates to the specifics of security in Customer Edge Switches and presents security models that protect hosts in private realms against attacks. The presented work is a part of a larger project that addresses many issues of the current Internet and proposes the use of CES as collaborative firewalls to reduce volume of unwanted traffic and mitigate Denial of Service (DoS) attacks in the Internet.",

However, many existing key management schemes for wireless sensor networks cannot achieve the two goals simultaneously. To solve the problem, the paper proposed a key management scheme based on hash chains and auxiliary nodes. In the scheme, adjacent sensor nodes can establish shared session keys with high probabilities; besides, the validity of chain keys including their identifiers can be distinguished by hash functions. Analyses show that the scheme not only can achieve the two goals to secure wireless sensor networks, but also can has advantages in terms of storage, communication overhead, and computation overhead.",

We propose a novel optical path-setup procedure that is able to configure multiple optical switches simultaneously. Our architecture uses a simple ring-based path-setup network for assisting an optical folded Torus Network-on-Chip (NoC) serving cache coherence traffic. We investigate performance/power effects on a CMP system and we compare against both a high-performance electronic folded Torus NoC (electronic baseline) and a state-of-the-art optical folded Torus with sequential path-setup (optical baseline). The reduced path-setup overhead of our proposal allows reconfigurable optical networks to potentially be compatible with the small messages composing directory-based cache coherent traffic and thus be the enabling factor for significantly improving energy consumption.",

                    "abstract": "There is a stage in the GPU computing pipeline where a grid of thread-blocks, or space of computation, is mapped to the problem domain. Normally, the space of computation is a k-dimensional bounding box (BB) that covers a k-dimensional problem. Threads that fall inside the problem domain perform computations and threads that fall outside are discarded, all happening at runtime. For problems with non-square geometry, this approach makes the space of computation larger than what is necessary, wasting many threads. Our case of interest are the two-dimensional triangular domain problems, alias td-problems, where almost half of the space of computation is unnecessary when using the BB approach. Problems such as the Euclidean distance map or collision detection are td-problems and they appear frequently as part of a larger computational problem. In this work, we study several mapping functions and their contribution to a better space of computation by reducing the number of unnecessary threads. We compare the performance of four existing mapping strategies; the bounding box (BB), the upper-triangular mapping (UTM), the rectangular box (RB) and the recursive partition (REC). In addition, we propose a map g(λ), that maps any λ block to a unique location (i, j) in the triangular domain. The mapping is based on the properties of the lower triangular matrix and works in block space. The theoretical improvement I obtained from using g(λ) is upper bounded as I <; 2 and the number of unnecessary blocks is reduced from O(n2) to O(n). Experimental results using different Nvidia Kepler GPUs show that for computing the Euclidean distance matrix g(λ) achieves an improvement of up to 18% over the basic bounding box (BB) strategy, runs faster than UTM and REC strategies and it is almost as fast as RB. Performance results on shared memory 3D collision detection show that g(λ) is the fastest map of all, and the only one capable of su- passing the brute force (BB) approach by a margin of up to 7%. These results help us realize that one of the main advantages of g(λ) is the fact that it uses block space mapping, where coordinate values are small in magnitude and thread organization is not compromised, making the map stable in performance under different memory access patterns.",

Several methods to detect possible hardware Trojans have been published, most of them aiming at detection during post-fabrication tests. Nevertheless, hardware Trojans are more probable to be inserted at design-level, as resources required to do so are much lower than those at fabrication. At design-level, verification methods have been shown to serve for Trojan detection. In this paper, we propose a design process to utilize verification methods in hardware Trojan detection, being able to be integrated into a state-of-the-art design flow for embedded systems. We outline the fundamental basics of verification methods and go then into the details of each step in the process. We identify assets and attackers, and outline which methods are suited to defend against which type of attack.",

Therefore, enterprise and clients want to shift their workloads towards green Cloud environment offered by the Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) provider. The main challenge for an IaaS provider is to determine the best trade-off between its profit while using renewable energy and customers satisfaction. In order to address this issue, we provide a Cloud energy broker, which can adjust the availability and price combination to buy Green energy dynamically from the market to make data center green. We investigate a simplified power model from where we can formulate and predict power demand. Our energy broker tries to maximize of using renewable energy under strict budget constraint whereas it also tries to minimize the use of brown energy by capping the limit of overall energy consumption of data center. The energy broker was evaluated with a real workload traced by Planet Lab. Experimental results show that our energy broker successfully keeps the best trade-off.",

These advantages, however, come at a steep cost of runtime overhead incurred by dynamic dependency resolution. Hardware support for task management has been proposed in previous work as a possible solution. We present VSs, a runtime library for the OmpSs programming model that integrates the Nexus++ hardware task manager, and evaluate the performance of the VSs-Nexus++ system. Experimental results show that applications with fine-grain tasks can achieve speedups of up to 3.4×, while applications optimized for current runtimes attain 1.3×. Providing support for hardware task managers in runtime libraries is therefore a viable approach to improve the performance of OmpSs applications.",

From the recent survey on protection of sensitive data, there is paucity of security in DoS attacks. In this paper, we have studied the Quantum algorithm approach and focused on the Quantum Swarm Evolutionary (QSE) algorithm and the Quantum-inspired Evolutionary Algorithm (QEA). The main aim of our work is to apply QSE algorithm with comparison of QEA on cloud computing to detect DoS attacks. We conducted an experiment methodology that shows that QSE is step above than the traditional QEA in this context.",

This estimation is designed to be applicable early in the design process, which enables system designer to evaluate different design variants with respect to the energy consumption of the later system. The energy estimation model is based on individual flowchart elements and execution probabilities for branches and iterations. The used flowchart elements are for arithmetical calculations, flow control and reads/writes, which are a selection of possible elements used to show the feasibility of the approach. The estimation model is verified in a first step by using three commercially available benchmarks. The flowcharts of these are utilized to estimate the energy consumption by using the presented model. The comparison between estimated and measured energy consumption of an exemplary embedded system results in an estimation error bandwidth between -11.9 % and +6.9 %. The main benefit of the presented approach is the applicability within the development phase \\\"System Design\\\" [1], i.e. Previous to any software implementation. This is realized by using only available information of that development phase and generic elements to estimate the energy consumption.",

The majority of low-power Wi-Fi modules for embedded systems has closed source firmware and protocol stack implementations, which prevents implementation and testing of new protocol features.

In this context, providing proper privacy and confidentiality services for the generated contents is a crucial issue to foster their development. We propose Snake, an end-to-end encrypted social network, where the confidentiality and privacy-protecting logic is shouldered entirely by the clients, improving the guarantees provided by state of the art solutions. We designed Snake so that the storage provider performs only simple data access operations, and the inspection of the data at rest does not reveal the involved parties in a communication. We implemented Snake as a single page HTML5 Java Script application employing W3C's Web Crypto API, and evaluated experimentally our approach proving its practical feasibility.",

In this paper we present a comprehensive analysis of the usage patterns of the headers included in the HTTP request messages of the clients. Our study shows that message headers vary significantly in terms of number, field names and field values. In general, Web browsers tend to specify in detail the client preferences by including in the request messages a large and variable number of headers. The usage patterns of these headers together with their field values provide some useful hints for website customization. On the contrary, the requests issued by Web robots are characterized by some distinctive patterns specific of the individual robots. These one-to-one correspondences between patterns and Web robots can then be used for their identification.",

The POR protocol can be run by the users to ensure that their images are stored securely in the cloud, and the POW protocol can be run by the cloud storage provider (CSP) to authenticate the true owner of the images. The efficiency of our scheme relies on the fact that only a fraction of the compressed data is used for encoding the images. Experimental results are provided to validate the stated goals.",

While previous work on signaling storms consider the processing overhead in the network and energy consumption of the misbehaving User Equipment (UE) only, this paper aims to investigate how signaling storms affect both the energy consumption and bandwidth allocation of normal and misbehaving LTE UEs by constructing a mathematical model which captures the interaction between the UE traffic and the Radio Resource Control state machine and bandwidth allocation mechanism at the eNodeB. Our results show that even if only a small proportion of the UE population is misbehaving, the energy consumption of the radio subsystem of the normal UEs can increase significantly while the time spent actively communicating increases drastically for a normal data session. Moreover, we show that misbehaving UEs have to spend an increasing amount of energy to attack the network when the severity of the signaling storms increases since they also suffer from the attacks.",

A common challenge for automated learning approaches is the demand for an effectively well-designed and fit for purpose system that meets the requirements and needs of intended learners to achieve their learning goals. This paper proposes a novel approach for automated learning that is capable of detecting changing trends in learning behaviours and abilities through the use of process mining techniques. The goal is to discover user interaction patterns, and respond by making decisions based on adaptive rules centred on captured user profiles. The approach applies semantic annotation of activity logs within the learning process in order to discover patterns automatically by means of semantic reasoning. Therefore, our proposed approach is grounded on Semantic modelling and process mining techniques. To this end, it is possible to apply effective reasoning methods to make inferences over a Learning Process Knowledge-Base that leads to automated discovery of learning patterns or behaviour.",

In modern processors, dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS) has been commonly used for energy reduction and temperature control. But with the variety of processor configurations, a DVFS arrangement that is energy efficient for one processor might not be appropriate for others. Furthermore, the efficiency of DVFS is also affected by the CPU intensiveness of the underlying tasks of the applications. In this paper, we propose a novel reinforcement learning based algorithm that dynamically controls the voltage and frequency of real-time systems and adjusts itself with diverse environments for optimal use of energy. Experimental results show that our proposed method can save significant amount of energy compared to other approaches.",

As an example application we investigate a typical algorithm employed in finite element codes for numerical integration. We create kernels implementing the algorithm for the two considered platforms and compare the performance obtained.",

This availability enables mobile users to use the cloud infrastructure to overcome the limitations of mobile technology, namely limited data storage, processing power and battery life. With the increasing use of mobile cloud computing, security issues remain a challenge. This paper investigates some available trusted platforms in order to pinpoint the question on how to secure the MCC under trusted platforms. This investigation comprises an overview of the security aspects of Trusted Platforms including Secure Elements (SE), Host Card Emulation (HCE), Trusted Execution Environment (TEE), and Trusted Platform Module (TPM). In addition, it shows how these platforms can be suitable for securing mobile Cloud computing.",

Selection and composition decisions tendto encounter numerous uncertainties: service consumers andapplications have little control of these services and tend to beuncertain about their level of support for the desired functionalitiesand non-functionalities. We contribute to an \\\"intelligent\\\"framework for selecting and composing services. The frameworkis ground on the premise of computationally self-awareness toinform decisions of selecting and composing the services to meetboth behavioral and functional requirements. The frameworkprovides the primitives for fine grained representation of knowledgeand levels of self-awareness for time, goal, interaction andstimuli. We have used volunteer service computing as an exampleto demonstrate the benefits that self-awareness can introduce toself-adaptation.",

The main barriere for the application of these techniques in industrial application is the state-space explosion problem, i.e., The lacking scalability of formal verification. To tackle this problem, we propose a modular verification framework that supports the whole design flow of embedded HW/SW system combining a variety of verification techniques, ranging from formal hardware verification over software verification to system verification. We target the system level design language SystemC, which has become the de facto standard in HW/SW co-design, but severely lacks support for automated and comprehensive verification. To achieve a modular and automatable verification flow, we start with a definition of an intermediate representation for SystemC (SysCIR). Then, we process the SysCIR by a set of modular engines. First, we aim at developing innovative slicing and abstraction engines, which significantly reduce the semantic state space. Second, we aim at providing a set of transformation engines that target a variety of verification tools. In particular, we combine hardware, software and system verification techniques in order to cope with the different models of computation inherently intertwined in embedded HW/SW systems.",

BI can be seamlessly deployed on the Cloud given that its multilayered model coincides with the Cloud models. It is considered by many Cloud service providers as one of the prominent applications services on public, outsourced private and outsourced community Clouds. However, in the shared domains of Cloud computing, BI is exposed to security and privacy threats by virtue of exploits, eavesdropping, distributed attacks, malware attacks, and such other known challenges on Cloud computing. Given the multi-layered model of BI and Cloud computing, its protection on Cloud computing needs to be ensured through multilayered controls. This paper proposed a multi-layered hierarchical inter-cloud connectivity model for sequential packet inspection of tenant sessions accessing BI as a service on cloud computing through an algorithm for ensuring multi-level session inspections, and ensuring maximum security controls at all the seven layers, and prevent an attack from occurring. The simulations present the effects of distributed attacks on the BI systems by attackers posing as genuine Cloud tenants. The results reflect how the attackers are blocked by the multilayered security and privacy controls deployed for protecting the BI servers and databases.",

                    "abstract": "Secure communication in Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) is usually based on symmetric cryptographic approaches, whose robustness relies on an efficient key management protocol. Most of the reported key management protocols follow either a centralized approach where a single node has the authority of distributing the global shared key, or a partially collaborative approach where key distribution is guaranteed by some master nodes. In this paper, a novel collaborative key management approach is proposed, where the whole network members participate in the key agreement task, thus, avoiding the existence of a master node, such as cluster head or BS that holds special information. Moreover, the global key is no longer propagated over the radio channel. Performance comparison with a well-known efficient scheme [1] as well as a recently reported scheme [3]shows that the proposed CGK approach reduces communication and storage overhead. Further, the analytical study of CGK is validated with simulation results.",

As multiple applications share common sensing resources, it is extremely important to maintain their Quality of Monitoring (QoM) at satisfactory levels. This is essentially an optimization problem subject to multiple constraints. To solve the problem, this paper proposes a novel admission control scheme to admit and execute new applications by taking into account both QoM and timing requirements. Set of simulation-based experiments verify that the proposed scheme can admit a new application in polynomial time. We also systematically analyze the impact and relations of different parameters determining the performance of our algorithm through a set of simulations.",

It concludes that Port of Shanghai has won the highest score belonging to the assessment Class I area, while Port of Lianyungang, Yantian, Jinzhou, Jiaxing and Wenzhou have got low scores belonging to the assessment Class IV area. The result shows that the Weighted Grey Target theory is a simple and effective method to assess the port informatizational performance.",

Unfortunately, it takes significant amounts of time and resources to explore a fraction of the design space. Herein, we present a heuristic, evolutionary approach (Genetic Algorithm) to exploration that significantly cuts down on the time and resources, obtaining a near optimal design. We demonstrate the real-world utility of our tool-chain \"CERE\" by rapidly and efficiently designing the cache hierarchy which maximizes the performance of a web-browser navigating to a set of famous websites running on a single ARM core. We rapidly traverse 134,136 possible configurations. At about two days per simulation on the Gem5 full system simulator, the entire space would have taken 268,272 CPU-Days or ≃734 CPU-Years (≃3.7 Years on a cluster of a hundred dual core machines) to brute force search. \"CERE\" provided results in ≃4.5 days and used ≃17.5 CPU-Days on our cluster. We ran the configurations that \"CERE\" chose through Gem5 to verify that \"CERE\" made the right choices and we were able to observe a 17.1% speedup going from the \"best\" hierarchy relative to the \"Worst\" hierarchy.",

Consequently, we study whether high-performance monitoring tasks can be carried out using off-the-shelf systems, the alternative to these pitfalls from the research community, consisting in the combination of open-source software and commodity hardware. We focus on sniffing and storing network traffic as one of the major tasks in any monitoring architecture. Specifically, we first review the keys to sniff traffic at multi-gigabit rates, and then present an experimental evaluation of commodity hard drives. Finally, the lessons learned from such studies and the performed experiments have conducted us to the development of an open solution, namely HPCAP, which sniffs and stores multi-gigabit traffic using commodity hardware without packet losses in very demanding scenarios.",

These networks offer improved throughput and latency with minimum distance routing in benign traffic patterns. As a solution to performance problems in adverse traffic pattern of the minimal routing, this article presents a misrouting solution. It uses two parameters to control the generation of routing tables. Using the paths on these tables, packets reach their destination nodes through non-minimal paths, without deadlock, live lock or starvation. Optimal values for the parameters are empirically determined. This routing strategy slightly improves the throughput while hardly increasing the base latency and extending the linear behaviour of the network. Experimental results confirm the good properties of this algorithm compared to minimal routing and Valiant algorithms.",

Although some techniques have been proposed that provide these security goals, most proposals lack a corresponding performance analysis. Thus, in this paper we provide an analytical analysis of the performance of several proposals. Following, to see the impact of different approaches on the runtime, we implemented the most promising schemes and compared them with respect to their required storage space and verification time. Furthermore, the identified computational bottlenecks of the techniques are presented and corresponding improvements are indicated. Finally, we show how to select a long-term archiving scheme and the appropriate key sizes based on trust assumptions and the number of documents to be archived.",

This transformation has been enabled primarily by the continuous development of Web applications. Inevitably-due to the Internet architecture-Web applications must rely on the servers so as to process and store confidential or user sensitive information. However, anyone who gains access to the server whether is a curious administrator, an attacker or even the government may obtain the data stored on the server or the server's database. This paper investigates ways to improve client-side security, through encryption, to keep user data private in the face of threats of various Web server compromises. A Web Application for online-note taking named Note Locker has been developed for this purpose by combining not only multiple security mechanisms but also modern Web development techniques to achieve confidentiality, integrity and a high level of user experience. The application is developed using open source products and eliminates possible attacks such as eavesdropping, sniffing, wiretapping, man-in-the-middle, and session hijacking of sensitive data by encrypting the data on the client side before sent for storage on the server.",

These different formats can make it difficult to handle the meshes in several aspects, for example when the same simulation should be checked and validated by another program or to preserve these data for long term. For both cases the conversion of finite element meshes can be a solution, however there is another problem in this case, that the size of the meshes are constantly increasing and meshes with over a million elements are commonly used nowadays. This paper would like to discuss how such large meshes can be converted in a parallel fashion and it also presents how this method can be used in the preservation and storage of finite element meshes.",

Coupling of a computational fluid dynamics and of a computational acoustics code is considered to simulate the acoustic fluid-structure interaction problem. Iterative Krylov methods and domain decomposition methods, tuned on Graphic Processing Unit (GPU), are considered to solve the acoustic problem with complex number arithmetics with double precision. Numerical simulations illustrate the efficiency, robustness and accuracy of the proposed approaches.",

Simulations were performed with two different nested domain configurations and the patterns and variability of near-surface winds over two selected areas of the Greek territory were compared with data from surface meteorological stations. Various verification statistics were utilized to gauge the ability of the model for accurate predictions and its performance for the different configurations was assessed. Finally, suggestions were made concerning performance optimization for high resolution simulations.",

We propose a novel covert channel mechanism based on BitTorrent trackers. The proposed mechanism uses common HTTP commands, thus having the appearance of genuine web traffic and consists of communications that are both indirect and asynchronous: no messages are directly exchanged between the sender and the receiver (of covert communications) and there is a potentially considerable delay between the sender's message to the relaying party and the receiver collecting this message. We present details of the proposed scheme in which a centralized BitTorrent tracker is used for storing covert messages and evaluate its performance based on the implemented prototype. We analyze the detectability of covert communications by an adversary and show that, while the common nature of the BitTorrent traffic and the large number of clients make the detection unlikely, the low temporal correlation between the writer and the reader (the two communicating parties) further increases the detection difficulty.",

Parallelization usually involves splitting a sequential thread, and schedule the split code to run on multiple cores. E.g. Some previous Speculative Multi-Threading research used code block reordering to automatically parallelize a sequential thread on multi-core processors. Although the parallelized code blocks can run on different cores, there may still be some data dependences among them. Therefore such parallelization will introduce data dependences among the cores where the code blocks run, which should be resolved alongside the execution by cross-core data sync. Cross-core data sync is usually expensive. This paper proposes to minimize the cross-core data sync with core affinity aware code block scheduling. Our work is based on an Speculative Multi-Threading (SpMT) approach with code block reordering. We improve it by implementing an affinity aware block scheduling algorithm. We built a simulator to model the SpMT architecture, and conducted experiments with SPEC2006 benchmarks. The data shows that plenty of cross-core data sync could be reduced (e.g. Up to 28.7% for gromacs) by the affinity aware block scheduling. For inter-core register sync delay of 5 cycles, this may suggest 3.73% increase in performance.",

Performing large scale experiments with different kind of network parameters is not easy because with supercomputers such parameters are fixed. So, one solution consists in using simulations first in order to analyze what parameters could influence or not the behavior of an algorithm. In this paper, we show that it is interesting to use SimGrid to simulate the behavior of asynchronous iterative algorithms. For that, we compare the behavior of a synchronous GMRES algorithm with an asynchronous multisplitting one with simulations which let us easily choose some parameters. Both codes are real MPI codes and simulations allow us to see when the asynchronous multisplitting algorithm can be more efficient than the GMRES one to solve a 3D Poisson problem.",

The emergence of context-aware services makes protecting the users' information an even greater challenge. Addressing this challenge requires an automatic mechanism that allows users to control their information at real-time. In this context, we propose a middleware called Context-Aware Privacy-preserving system Supervised by users (CAPRIS), which provides users with groups of policies that form profiles to protect their privacy in the environment in which they are located. CAPRIS lets users to control and supervise at real-time the information they are revealing to other users who use context-aware services. Semantic technologies play a key role in our solution. We use ontologies for shaping the space and context, and semantic rules defining the privacy policies that form the context-aware profiles. Some experiments measuring the throughput and scalability of CAPRIS confirm that our solution improves other related works.",

Thedistributed file systems inherit many components fromcentralized ones and use them in a distributed manner. There aretwo ways to grow the storage capacity: by scaling-up or byscaling-out and growing the number of storage devices in astorage system. The growth of storage devices impose manychallenges related to interconnection protocols and topologies,error handling, data consistency, security and so on. In thisarticle we have studied how distributed and parallel storageshave evolved from direct connected storages in terms ofarchitecture, data management and organization and how thenew challenges imposed by data distribution have been solved.We have selected for studying several of the most representativedistributed storages solutions: Andrew File System, Google FileSystem, General Parallel File System, Lustre and Ceph. First, weemphasize how a generic distributed storage layout has inspiredfrom structured disk layout (Berkeley Fast File System). Second,we describe the evolution path of distributed storages from awide variety of perspectives, including: distributed units whichare moving from blocks to objects due to their undeniableadvantages or distribution methods that have evolved from listsmuch like inode mapping to deterministic hash functions likeRUSH or CRUSH. Third, the networks are evolving very fast interms of topologies and protocols. Using graph theory,researchers are continuously improving different aspects ofcluster networks. Fourth, storage security is a critical componentdue to the demand of storing sensitive data for long term, sharingit in a secure way and impacting as little as possible the systemperformance.",

Usable security is understood as one required pillar for developing effective protection means in this context. We therefore survey and discuss on available usable security mechanisms against phishing. Our investigations show that existing solutions contain too many obstacles for the users. This experienced ambiguity is further amplified by the vast amount of distinct designs varying amongst vendors, platforms and versions of web browsers even within one class of security warnings. This paper introduces a novel anti-phishing mechanism which relies on the idea that the whole appearance of a web application is dress able according to an individual user's preferences. The guiding principle behind our proposal is to implant security warnings as an intrinsic part of the application instead of having it placed somewhere in the runtime environment, which is the web browser in this context. One goal is to render the cloning of a website practically infeasible for an attacker by increasing the number of web pages to retrieve and store in order to create an identical copy of that site. The second and more important goal is to raise the attention of the users for an unofficial site due to a wrong appearance which is not in conformance with an actual user's page dress. A user study based on a developed online banking service supporting our suggested UI-Dressing has been conducted. It reveals that the proposed approach takes the desired effect in empowering users to detect fake sites and thus makes our introduced approach a valuable path to follow up.",

One problem in the decision marking is to develop systems able to help the coordination of the different involved teams. Another challenge is to make the system work with a degraded communication infrastructure. Each workstation or embedded application must be able to help to make a decision with a degraded network by taking into account the potential decisions made by other agents. We propose in this article a multi-agent model, based on an ant colony optimization, and designed to manage the complexity in the deployment of resources to solve a crisis. This model is able to manage data uncertainty, and its global goal is to optimize, in a stable way, fitness functions, like saving lives, defined by multiple users. Moreover, thanks to a reflexive process, the model is able to manage the effects into the environment of its decisions, in order to take more appropriate decisions. Thanks to our transactional model, the system is also able to take into account a large data amount without exploring all potential solutions. The graphical interface should be able to make the user defining rules database. %Each rule associates, for each potential event, a goal with its fitness functions, and a list of possible tasks to do. Then, if the nature of the crisis is deeply unchanged, users should be able to change rules' databases.",

Pixels belonging to edges of the cover image are used as the embedding locations. The edge selection approach is data adaptive that means, numbers of pixels belonging to edges are selected on the basis of payload to be embedded. The embedding approach is designed to provide better security. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed technique outperforms the existing practical state-of-the-art techniques and at par with simulated version of minimizing distortion based approach.",

Compared to CPUs, GPUs can achieve higher performances at accelerating the programs' execution in an energy-efficient way. Therefore GPGPU computing is useful for high performance computing applications and in many scientific research fields. In order to bring further performance improvements, GPU clusters are increasingly adopted. The energy consumed by GPUs cannot be neglected. Therefore, an energy-efficient time scheduling of the programs that are going to be executed by the parallel GPUs based on their deadline as well as the assigned priorities could be deployed to face their energetic avidity. For this reason, we present in this paper a model enabling the measure of the power consumption and the time execution of some elementary operations running on a single GPU using a new developed energy measurement protocol. Consequently, using our methodology, energy needs of a program could be predicted, allowing a better task scheduling.",

The proposed observer can track the fluid-flow model representing the TCP/IP behaviors in a router level. Unlike traditional sliding-mode observers, the proposed observer behaves as a full-order dynamics during the sliding-mode motion. The smooth control signal of the observer can be directly utilized to estimate the queue length dynamics representing a distributed anomaly in the TCP/IP network. The simulations are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

Nonetheless, the extremely variegated scenarios of application call for new specialized solutions, to best satisfy their possibly peculiar requirements. In this paper, we propose a randomized approach to the design of compact hash tables for network applications that need to frequently store and access short valued data. The approach is based on the use of a bank of Bloom filters and proves to be very effective both in terms of space occupancy and complexity, at the obvious cost of a non zero error probability.",

Clock synchronization protocol, as one of the most important industrial communication protocols, ensures the real-time performance of industrial control system. Considering that the related researches have not yet formed a mature system, we propose a new method for analyzing the vulnerability of clock synchronization protocol in this article. In this method, SPN(stochastic petri net) is introduced as a modeling tool, while IEEE 1588 PTP clock synchronization protocol is regarded as the research object. An SPN(stochastic petri net) model is strictly built according to the protocol. Then, steady-state probability expressions are obtained by the isomorphic Markov chain. Through changing trigger rate of transitions of several pivotal states which are related to vulnerability, the influences of each parameter has on the model could be quantitatively reflected in the result of simulation in order to analyze vulnerability of clock synchronization protocol by determining the critical factors that affect protocol's vulnerability.",

They are more and more used, even in On-Line Transaction Processing (OLTP) systems and for scientific data with hard constraints on response time. Consequently, parallel execution and parallel access to data are capital to fulfil this performance requirement. The SSD internal structure provides a potential for parallel access at different levels which can be exploited to match the concurrency naturally present in both OLTP and scientific applications. In this paper, the SSD behaviour is analysed considering two degrees of internal parallelism associated to inter Dies (degree 1) and inter Planes (degree 2) parallelisms and compared to a sequential scheme (degree 0) as a reference. The study is conducted using representative workloads for both OLTP and scientific applications. The obtained results are significant and show the important performance gain of exploiting the internal SSD parallelism (up to ×44 for OLTP). The gain is less important for scientific applications due to their requests size distributions and the interleaving of read/write streams. In conjunction with priority and pre-emption scheduling strategies, an additional impact is observed, which can be very modest or a factor of ×10 according to the context, with a significant impact only if priority is associated to preemption.",

The focus on this paper is on Newton's method, which requires the evaluation of the polynomials, their derivatives, and the solution of a linear system to compute the update to the current approximation for the solution. The reverse mode of algorithmic differentiation for a product of variables is rewritten in a binary tree fashion so all threads in a block can collaborate in the computation. For double arithmetic, the evaluation and differentiation problem is memory bound, whereas for complex quad double arithmetic the problem is compute bound. With acceleration we can double the dimension and get results that are twice as accurate in about the same time.",

Consequently, a high requirement of computing power characterize them. To satisfy this need, it's inevitable today to use parallel and heterogeneous architectures in order to speedup the processing, where the best examples are today's supercomputers like \\\"Tianhe-2\\\" and \\\"Titan\\\" of Top500 ranking. These architectures with their multi-core nodes supported by many-core accelerators offer a good response to this problem. However, they are still hard to program to make performance because of many reasons: Parallelism expression, task synchronization, memory management, hardware specifications handling, load balancing In the present work, we are characterizing gls[dsp] applications and propose a programming model based on their distinctiveness in order to implement them easily and efficiently on heterogeneous clusters.",

However, e.g. For Java-based web development education a more easy-to-use platform is desired. In addition, to design a future PaaS cloud environment for education a lightweight, highly scalable and ressource-efficient platform is required. Therefore, in this paper a solution for building an easy-to-use, lightweight application server environment for hosting PHP or Java EE-based web applications is proposed, which is based on open source software (OSS) components. Evaluation results for the proposed solution with respect to its practical use in a classroom setting as well as its performance and scalability are presented.

SWs have emerged as a major technology for deploying automated interactions between distributed and heterogeneous applications. This computing technology can be used to discover new distributed and heterogeneous collaborative applications of large-scale distributed systems in P2P systems. In this paper, we present a scalable P2P approach for distributed discovery of SWs. In this approach, we define a distributed solution based on epidemic discovery algorithm to achieve a specific goal through the distributed discovery of SWs in P2P networks. In order to improve the applicability of the epidemic discovery algorithm for discovering SWs, we propose the matching of ontology OWL-S in the heart of this algorithm which reduces the search space while keeping an acceptable matching quality level. Our matching approach relies on the use of several similarity metrics. Moreover, our matching approach is able to detect complex mappings between activities based on their parameters of OWL-S.",

Aho-Corasick (AC) is a multiple patterns string matching algorithm commonly used in computer and network security, bioinformatics, among others. In order to simultaneously match a number of string patterns with respect to the input text data, a Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) is constructed from a given set of pattern strings. The DFA is referenced almost randomly, whereas the input data is sequentially accessed. As the number of pattern strings increases, the irregular DFA accesses lead to poor cache locality and low overall performance. In this paper, we present a cache locality optimizing parallelization on the many-core accelerator chip, the Intel Xeon Phi. A given set of pattern strings is partitioned into into multiple sets of a smaller number of patterns so that multiple small DFAs are constructed instead of single large DFA. The accesses to multiple small DFAs lead to significantly smaller cache footprints in each core's cache and result in impressive performance improvements. Experimental results on the Intel Xeon Phi 5110P show that our approach delivers up to 2.00 × speedup compared with the previous approach using single large DFA.",

Cloud computing not only provides ubiquitous access, but also, ease of management of hugely increasing data. The next era is going to be of cloud federation, in which services would be brought up to the user through multiple clouds, creating an Inter-Cloud computing environment. One of the key entities in Inter-Cloud computing is Cloud Broker. Cloud Broker plays an important role in cloud federation environment. Broker has to reserve resources and perform pricing and billing. We have proposed a model for this purpose and presented here, along with its performance evaluation.",

Existing execution time models however, use to rely on off-line analysis or on the assumption that the memory access time (quantified in processor cycles) is constant, ignoring that memory system components are not affected by the processor clock. In this paper, we propose the Processor-Memory (Proc-Mem) model, which dynamically predicts the execution time of the applications running in a multicore processor when varying the processor frequency. Proc-Mem approach is compared with a typical Constant Memory Access Time model, namely CMAT. Results show that the deviation of Proc-Mem is always lower than 6% with respect to the measured execution time, while the deviation of the CMAT model always exceeds 30%. These results turn in important energy savings for a similar number of deadline misses. Energy savings are on average by 22.9%, and up to 47.8% in the studied mixes.",

The DIBE scheme extends the traditional IBE to a distributed system which consists of some homogenous or heterogeneous subsystems. Each subsystem has its own different master key and can communicate each other in a secure mode, instead of sharing a common master key as that in a traditional IBE scheme. The paper presents and analyzes the key distributing algorithms for a subsystem to join or leave a system, and also a user to joining or leave a subsystem. It shows that the DIBE scheme has the properties of scalability and adaptability. The paper also analyzes the security and performance of the proposed scheme, including the correctness, complexity and application examples. Some simulation results demonstrate the performance of the DIBE by using the PBC function packet.",

The high-level of hardware abstraction provided by task-based paradigms make them excellent candidates for writing portable codes that can consistently deliver high performance across a wide range of platforms. While this paradigm has proved efficient for achieving such goals for dense and sparse linear solvers, it is yet to be demonstrated that industrial parallel codes relying on the classical Message Passing Interface (MPI) standard and that accumulate dozens of years of expertise (and countless lines of code) may be revisited to turn them into efficient task-based programs. In this paper, we study the applicability of task-based programming in the case of a Reverse Time Migration (RTM) application for Seismic Imaging. The initial MPI-based application is turned into a task-based code executed on top of the PaRSEC runtime system. Preliminary results show that the approach is competitive with (and even potentially superior to) the original MPI code on an homogenous multicore node and can exploit much more efficiently complex hardware such as a cache coherent Non Uniform Memory Access (ccNUMA) node or an Intel Xeon Phi accelerator.",

Two major parameters used to evaluate multicast routing are the time it takes to deliver the message to all destinations and the traffic which refers to the total number of links involved. Direct network especially mesh connected is the most popular network topology used in multicomputer because its scalability. It has been proved that, in mesh network, it is NP-hard to find the multicast routing which is optimal on both time and traffic. In this paper, we proposed two efficient multicast algorithms designed for store and-forward switched mesh-connected multicomputers, called DIAG and DDS. Both algorithms are tree-based shortest path multicast algorithms with total complexity of O(KN) or less. Performance evaluations of these algorithms for 3D mesh and torus is presented at the end of the paper.",

We motivate the need for a dynamic and adaptive framework for securing identities at runtime. The solution explores the link between Identity Security Goals, the features they require (e.g. Anonymity, Integrity) and the provisioned underlying computational resources (e.g. Memory, CPU) in federated environments. We report on an economics inspired approach, which utilizes an auction procedure for dynamic allocation of resources for adaptively securing identities at runtime. The solution is realized as a simulation and tested on the cloud specific area of federated identity management.",

However, with modern day Cloud platforms offeringa scalable service infrastructure, current HPC domain expertscontinue to deliberate on the usage of Cloud Computing platformsas an alternate cost effective and efficient way of procuring justin time computing. At the same time, there are a variety offactors to be considered before HPC workloads such as weatherforecasting can be moved to a Cloud infrastructure. In this paper,we have studied the performance characteristics of WeatherResearch and Forecasting (WRF) algorithm on three differentcomputing architectures. The architectures include two publicdomain Cloud service providers and a virtual machine (VM)based setup. Through detailed experiments, we have performeda rigorous comparative analysis of the performance of WRF ineach of these architectures and in that process we have identifiedthe strengths and weaknesses of each architecture for such HPCworkloads. We believe our work of comparing across 3 differentarchitectures is the first of its kind and could be seen as a pilotreference useful to domain experts and system administratorswho are considering to employ Cloud Computing for specificHPC problems.I",

The main focus of the paper is on execution of scientific algorithms (such as algorithms from the music information retrieval domain) by enabling the sharing of algorithm implementations, the reproducibility of results, and an easy access to non-experts of distributed environments. We propose a method of automatic deployment of client command line applications in PaaS and IaaS clouds which, unlike to existing approaches, requires neither preliminary platform configuration, nor platform configuration description. We designed a deployment manager using an expert system in order to automatically setup a virtual execution platform, by resolving dependencies and solving configuration issues on the basis of a pre-existing knowledge base.",

Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks (CRSNs) overcome this problem by allowing sensor nodes to access opportunistically the underutilized licensed spectrum bands. The sink assigns the spectrum holes to the secondary users (SUs). Therefore, it must rely on reliable information about the spectrum holes to protect the primary users (PUs). In this paper the sink uses two ways to determine the available channels and alerts the SUs if an unexpected activity of PU occurs. Our objective is to design an algorithm able to detect the unexpected presence of PUs in the multi-hop network while maximizing the throughput. To achieve our goal, we propose an optimized version of our previous scheduling algorithm Opportunistic centralized Time slot assignment in Cognitive Radio sensor networks (OTICOR). We then evaluate its performance in terms of number of slots and throughput.",

In this context, current SRAM-error detection and correction proposals incur on a significant performance penalty since they increase access latency and disable cache lines that cannot be corrected, so decreasing the effective cache capacity. This reduction implies more cache misses, so enlarging the execution time which, contrary to expected, can turn in higher energy consumption. This paper characterizes SRAM failures at very-low voltages and presents an evaluation methodology to analyze the impact on energy consumption of error correction approaches. To do so, several voltage/frequency pairs are studied and the optimal pair is identified from an energy point of view. To focus the research, experimental results have been obtained for the recently proposed fault-tolerant HER cache. Results show that, for a 32nm technology node, the voltage/frequency pair of 0.45V/800MHz, which induces by 31% SRAM failure rate, provides the lowest overall energy consumption (by 62% energy savings compared to a non-faulty conventional cache).",

This paper considers a benefit model for on-line pre-emptive multiprocessor scheduling. The goal is to maximize the total benefit gained by the jobs that meet their deadlines. This method prioritizes the jobs using their benefit density functions and schedules them in a real-time basis. We propose an online choice of two approximation algorithms in order to partition the jobs among identical processors at the time of their arrival without using any statistics. Our analysis and experiments show that we are able to maximize the gained benefit and decrease the computational complexity (compared to existing algorithms) while minimizing make span (response time, also referred to as cost), with fewer missed deadlines and more balanced usage of processors. Our solution is applicable to a wide variety of soft real-time applications and embedded systems such as, but not limited to multimedia applications, medical monitoring systems or those with higher utilization such as bursty hosting servers.",

The first architecture is an Intel x64 ISA based homogenous multicore with Uniform Memory Access (UMA) type shared-memory based Symmetric Multi-Processing system. The second architecture is an IBM Power ISA based heterogenous multicore with Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) based distributed-memoryAsymmetric Multi-Processing system. The two HPC algorithms are for predicting biological molecular structures, specifically the RNA secondary structures. The first algorithm that we created is a parallelized version of a popular serial RNA secondary structure prediction algorithm called PKNOTS. The second algorithm is a new parallel-by-design algorithm that we have developed called MARSs. Using real Ribo-Nucleic Acid(RNA) sequences, we conducted large-scale experiments involving hundreds of sequences using the above two algorithms. Based on thousands of data points that we collected as an outcome of our experiments, we report on the observed performance metrics for both the algorithms on the two architectures. Through our experiments, we infer that architectures with specialized coprocessors for number-crunching along with high-speed memory bus and dedicated bus controllers generally perform better than general-purpose multi-processor architectures. In addition, we observed that algorithms that are intrinsically parallelized by design are able to scale & perform better by taking advantage of the underlying parallel architecture. We further share best practices on handling scalability aspects with regards to workload size. We believe our results are applicable to other HPC applications on similar HPC architectures.",

Cloud providers offer dynamicity, abstraction and centralized management to make their cloud services more attractive for prospective clients. With the formation of cloud computing market's ecosystem, cloud providers will find themselves in need to cooperate between each other to gain economy of scale using federation. Cloud resource federation introduces extra-dynamicity into services, but might lead rigidly developed applications to fail in satisfying its basic role. Losing all the investment made on an application is definitely not an option for most cloud providers. In this paper we are interested in proving that not all cloud applications are ready for federation and this will highlight the need to create a formal verification method to check the readiness of an application to be federated. In this context we study \\\"Privacy-as-a-Service\\\" as a sample of rigidly developed cloud services and prove that critical security vulnerability will be created if this service is federated. We then propose a federation ready message flow that covers the confidentiality vulnerabilities in PasS and this highlights possible criteria to be checked in future verification methods.",

The suite is build around the application of a Monte Carlo method to a scenario where some intelligent threat agents sequentially select and compose attacks to reach their goals. Some tools of the suites build a description of a scenario with the agents, the target system, its vulnerabilities and the attacks they enable. Starting from this description, another tool applies a Monte Carlo method to simulate step by step the attacks of each agent and populate a database with samples on the attacks the agents implement, the goal they reach and the time this takes. Further tools use this database to produce statistics to assess the risk and to select countermeasures to be deployed. Since several tools of the suite require information on both the agents and the target system, we discuss how to conduct a robust assessment even when only a partial information is available. To exemplify the proposed approach, we describe the assessment of an industrial control system.",

Networking capability is one of the most desired features even for embedded systems, hence network applications, typically used in desktop systems, are required to become available in the embedded system domain. Rewriting these applications to fit into embedded root file systems takes time and effort that may entail a considerable cost. On the other hand, using the existing desktop applications is a good strategy, although introducing many challenges. Formulating storage specifications is easy, but it is not the same for memory as traditionally used memory tools do not utilize the Proportional Set Size value. A thoroughly architecture-independent development methodology is proposed about the construction of an optimized medium-sized network embedded system utilizing the large GNU/Linux code base and emulation. It expands from building, optimizing and comparing libraries, commonly used in embedded systems, optimizing applications to emulating the final system, constructed by an integrated building environment, so as to check functionality and to acquire insight about useful metrics that aid the decision making process. An application of the methodology, focused on the ARM architecture, was deployed demonstrating the value of it, which proves much more efficient than using Android for such constraint environments.",

While decoding a frame, the scheme measures \\\"slack\\\" and \\\"overshoot\\\" over the budgeted decode time and amortises across the neighboring frames to achieve overall QoS, compensating for the overshoot with the slack time. It allocates, on a per-frame basis, an appropriate number of cores for decoding to guarantee QoS, while saving energy by using clock gating to switch off unused cores. Using the Sniper simulator to evaluate the implementation of the scheme on a modern embedded processor, we get an energy saving of 6% to 61% while strictly adhering to the required QoS. Thus, we show that substantial energy savings can be achieved in video decoding by employing dynamic core allocation, compared with the default strategy of allocating as many cores as available.",

We observe that this API remoting mechanism often involves large-volume and frequent data transmissions between the host OS and the guest OS, which lead to a significant performance degradation. We present an address mapping scheme so the host can directly access the machine memory space of the guest and thus avoid data copying between the guest and the host. To reduce the frequency of data transmissions, we introduce a delayed submission scheme. We implement both address mapping and delayed submission in KVM. Our evaluation on a set of CUDA benchmarks shows that address mapping can improve over the original gVirtuS by up to 6.5 times. Delayed submission is able to further reduce the virtualization overhead by half in a pathological case.",

Actors collaboratively respond to achieve predefined application mission. However, since the environment where WSANs are used is usually complex and harsh, actors cannot communicate with its neighbor actors occasionally due to the failure of an actor. Although the recent work provides a connection restoration scheme between actors, disconnection intermittently occurs since each actor moves to new position one-by-one. In this paper, we propose a concurrent moving-based connection restoration scheme between actors to ensure the continuous connectivity. By sending a message to neighbor actor before moving, an actor can inform when it starts to move and where it moves to. Thus, neighbor actors which receive a message can calculate when it starts to move for concurrent move of actors. An actor starts to move when the communication with neighbor actors is unavailable due to neighbor actor's move. Further, when the actor starts to move, it creates sub-paths to its moving neighbor actor for continuous connectivity. The network restoration time is shortened because of concurrently moving instead of moving one by one. We show that our scheme restores the network connectivity much robuster and faster than the conventional scheme by computer simulation.",

To achieve anywhere and anytime connectivity, inter working different network technologies is an important issue to consider. If we consider a Multi Interface Mobile User supporting WLAN and Cellular networks which is under the coverage of a WLAN and a cellular network in the same time. The main objective of a Mobile User is to benefit from the high Quality of Service (QoS) with the minimum cost. If the WLAN can satisfy the Mobile User requirements in terms of QoS, no network switching is required. Otherwise, switching to the cellular network is required. Seamless switching between different wireless technologies referred as Vertical Handover is becoming a requirement nowadays. In our paper, we address the Mobility Management between the LTE and the Mobile Ad hoc Networks (MANETs).",

An axiom in numerical weather prediction suggests that modeling the environment at high resolution optimizes forecast accuracy. However, due to operational time constraints, only the region immediately surrounding a single hurricane can be modeled in high resolution. Currently, this is achieved by embedding a relatively small high resolution, storm-following pair of grids within a larger and coarser grid. In a previous work, we extended HWRF to support multiple such independent storm-following pair of grids. The result was improved forecast accuracy by virtue of modeling storm-to-storm interactions in high resolution. However, some shortcomings in the underlying WRF framework cause these independent pairs of grids to be simulated sequentially. This limits the model's scalability and makes it impossible to harness this novel capability within the operational time constraints. In this paper, we address this issue by modifying the underlying WRF framework to simulate these independent pairs of storm-following grids in parallel. This is the first approach to be successfully implemented in the history of the WRF framework.",

Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is a key in HHT and decomposes data into multiple Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs). Traditionally, EMD is computed on all data points in a serial manner, thus making its execution time grows at least linearly with the data size. In this work, a 3-stage parallelized EMD algorithm working on a CUDA architecture is proposed to improve performance over traditional EMD. Moreover, additional merging cubic spline interpolation (MCSI) and GPU acceleration techniques are also incorporated for achieving high parallelism and high accuracy. Experimental result shows that our parallelized EMD in CUDA achieves 37.9x and 33.7X speedups with 0.0051% and 0.002% errors on voice and EEG datasets of 1-million points, respectively.",

No past partitioning schemes explicitly consider cache effects. We present a partitioning scheme called LWFG, which minimizes cache misses by partitioning tasks that share memory onto the same core and by evenly distributing the total working set size across cores. Our implementation reveals that LWFG improves execution efficiency and reduces mean maximum tardiness over past works by as much as 15% and 60%, respectively.",

Through an interactive embedding process that incorporates keyed hash functions and human reviewed sentences, the system generates two innocuous natural language carriers that ultimately optimise payload secrecy. Conventionally, the first carrier (carrier-text) hosts a payload of secret bits. The second carrier, referred to as an open-stego-key, hosts sentences used as keys to extract a payload from a carrier-text. Notable aspects of our approach include the scope to offset embedding distortion from a carrier-text to an open-stego-key, as well as the scope to resize a carrier-text for optimal transmission via capacity constrained channels (e.g. Twitter, SMS), at the expense of a larger open-stego-key, that is transmitted via an alternative channel (e.g. Social media, blog, forum, email).",

Therefore, the task of adjusting the values of parameters of hybrid parallel applications to achieve the best performance requires a high degree of expertise and a huge effort. Determining a performance model that considers all the system and application features is a very complex task that in most cases produces poor results. In order to simplify this goal and improve the results, we introduce a model-based regression tree technique to improve the accuracy of performance prediction for parallel Master/Worker applications on homogeneous multicore systems. The technique has been used to model the iteration time of the general expression for performance prediction. This approach significantly reduces the effort in getting an accurate prediction model, although it requires a relatively large training data set. The proposed model determines the configuration of the appropriate number of workers and threads of the hybrid application to achieve the best possible performance.",

The first resource scheme exploits transmission power control mechanism in order to improve energy efficiency and network capacity while the second resource allocation scheme takes into account the connection quality and network traffic in order to reduce data transfer time. To balance the trade-off between first two schemes a network-aware and power-based resource allocation scheme is proposed which takes into account transmission power and network characteristics in order to make allocation decisions. The relationship between data transfer time and transmission energy consumption has also been investigated in detail. The schemes are validated in a simulated environment using various workloads and parameters.",

However, channel conditions in wireless networks can affect both throughput and reliability. Cooperative communication has the advantage of offering throughput enhancement and reliability in wireless networks by using several single-antenna nodes to form a virtual antenna array. The performance in cooperative communication depends on the relay selection scheme. Therefore, in this paper, we propose and evaluate a distributed relay-selection scheme based on the channel conditions of candidate relay nodes. Results show that our proposed-relay selection scheme increases the system throughput.",

Organisations take extreme care to provision and configure their environments and they are very wary to change. This is because a small change may result to a domino effect of failures resulting in costly system downtime. Consequently, engineers are also looking for reliable ways of testing environmental changes prior to deploying to production. One way is to maintain an exact replica of the production environment which is used to test and verify changes (software and hardware changes). However, this is an expensive solution to test small recurrent changes and doubles the support cost. Another approach is to simulate. This work is about simulation and how the principles of Zero Deviation Life Cycle (ZDLC) methodology have been employed to simulate changes of deploying software to an enterprise production environment in the banking arena.",

The dynamic deployment and on-demand applications are also major challenges. To ensure this deployment, it is essential to rely on methods of managing applications and services in a cloud. This paper proposes to apply the concept of Virtual Appliance for cloud architectures to ensure the dynamic deployment, interoperability and reuse of services supported by these clouds. Proposed architecture aims to solve problems of users whose are blocked from sellers with very little flexibility to move their services to other providers. Using standards of DMTF could provide more flexibility and response to user's requirement under SLA constraints.",

From an application developer's perspective, itis also important that code can be maintained in a portablemanner across a range of hardware. Here we present targetDP(target Data Parallel), a lightweight programming layer thatallows the abstraction of data parallelism for applications thatemploy structured grids. A single source code may be used totarget both thread level parallelism (TLP) and instruction levelparallelism (ILP) on either SIMD multi-core CPUs or GPUacceleratedplatforms. targetDP is implemented via standard Cpreprocessor macros and library functions, can be added toexisting applications incrementally, and can be combined withhigher-level paradigms such as MPI. We present CPU and GPUperformance results for a benchmark taken from the latticeBoltzmann application that motivated this work. These demonstratenot only performance portability, but also the optimisationresulting from the intelligent exposure of ILP.",

Searchable encryption satisfies the need of users to execute a search encrypted data. Previous searchable encryption methods such as \\\"public key encryption with keyword search (PEKS)\\\" restricted the data access to certain users, because only the assigned users were able to search the encrypted data. In this paper we will discuss the relation between Attribute Based Encryption (ABE) and searchable encryption and define a weak anonymity of the ABE scheme, named \\\"attribute privacy\\\". With this weak anonymity, we propose a general transformation from ABE to Attribute Based Encryption with Keyword Search (ABEKS) and a concrete attribute private key-policy ABE (KP-ABE) scheme. We present an ABEKS scheme based on this KP-ABE scheme and permit multi-users to execute a flexible search on the remote encrypted data. We have proposed a KP-ABE scheme with \\\"attribute privacy\\\" features.We have introduced a general transformation from the KP-ABE scheme to the ABEKS scheme.We have designed a secure ABEKS scheme by the transformation.We have provided the proof of security and consistency of the ABEKS scheme.",

Local texture and global texture clarity of fingerprint images are the main factors in the evaluation of FIQ. Available image size, dryness and Singular Points (SPs) of a fingerprint image are also considered as cofactors, each of them has different effect on the assessment of image quality. In this paper, Homogeneous-Zones-Divide is proposed to evaluate the global clarity of a fingerprint image. To be consistent with human perception of fingerprint images quality, the optimal weight is obtained by a constrained nonlinear optimization model. This optimal weight is further used to assess Composite Quality Score (CQS). Simulation on public database indicates that the precision of our method can achieve 97.5% of accurate rate and it can reasonably classify fingerprint images into four grades, which is helpful to improve the performance of (AFIS).",

Under leakage assumption(the verifier uses side-channel attacks to obtain some information about the secret state of the prover), the known zero knowledge protocol may not preserve zero knowledge any more. Garg et.al. first studied leakage-resilient zero knowledge and presented an excellent construction for NP. Unfortunately, the definition is not suitable for honest verifier leakage-resilient zero knowledge. In this paper, we give a new definition of leakage-resilient zero knowledge and construct a leakage-resilient zero knowledge proof for approximate version of the closest vector problem(GAPCVPγ). We also give a definition of leakage-resilient bit commitment scheme.",

Along with the rapid growth of the RFID technology, security issues have acquired much attention recently. However, most of the RFID security works focus on fake identity or information leaking problems. Researchers seldom care about the security of system mechanism, such as media access control. This paper focuses on the anti-collision mechanism of ISO15693. We analyze the 16-slot anti-collision in ISO15693 in detail, demonstrate access vulnerability, present a potential attack approach of similar-tags collision and validate the attack efficiency through simulation. Afterwards, an improved anti-collision paradigm is proposed to mitigate the similar-tags attack. The empirical study shows that the improved anti-collision tactic is much more efficient than that in ISO15693.",

On the other hand, challenges arise in areas like I/O processing due to overheads experienced in virtualized environments. Designs of I/O controllers have to be adjusted to allow efficient, scalable, and real-time capable communication under these circumstances. Interrupts are an essential part in real-time communication. However, they introduce significant computational overheads, because they force multiple context switches within the CPU. Interrupt coalescing reduces the burden of interrupt processing by merging multiple interrupts within the I/O hardware. However, existing coalescing approaches are not feasible for real-time networks like CAN due to the latencies they introduce. In this paper, we introduce a deadline-aware approach of interrupt coalescing for CAN controllers. It minimizes the amount of interrupts forwarded while guaranteeing the systems real-time capability. We provide three approximations of the method, which can be implemented in hardware. We evaluate the reduction of interrupts that can be achieved with each approach and determine the hardware cost with a prototypical FPGA implementation.",

Numerical experiments, for medieval glass rendering within the church of the Royaumont abbey, illustrate the performance of the proposed ray-tracing domain decomposition method (DDM) on multi-cores and multi-processors architectures. On one hand, applying domain decomposition techniques increases speedups obtained by parallelizing the computation. On the other hand, for a fixed number of parallel processes, we notice that speedups increase as the number of sub-domains do.",

BTE numerical solvers are involved in various physical contexts such as nuclear core simulation. A large class of BTE solvers are based on a so-called sweep algorithm that represents the vast majority of the computing operations. In this work, we present an implementation of this sweep algorithm on top of the Parsec runtime. This implementation combines efficiently three levels of parallelism: SIMD, Multi-Threads, and Message Passing. Measured performance on a supercomputer having 768cores reaches 6.2 Tflop/s, and corresponds to 34.4% of the theoretical peak performance of this supercomputer.",

One way to prepare the Exascale challenge is to manage uncertainties. Several approximations occur during a numerical simulation from the physical world to the floating point computation. Among these uncertainties, the floating-point arithmetic approximation will be more and more taken into account to perform a rigorous Verification & Validation process. It will also help to explain possible non numerical reproducibility, to optimize the amount of memory for a specified precision on the results and to improve the software development chain. This paper presents an overview of the numerical verification performed at EDF R&D on the CFDTELEMAC-MASCARET software suite.",

However, the performance improvement to be achieved is not always in the orders of magnitude range. In this paper, we present the challenging example of designing a parallel version of a model fitting algorithm used in calibrating telescope observation data in radio astronomy. The complexity of the application, together with the limited opportunities for code modification, bound the performance gain that any parallel system could achieve. However, we show how classical \\\"bound-and-bottleneck\\\" analysis and optimization using multicore architectures help achieving up to 2.3x \\\"wall clock\\\" speedup compared to the original sequential implementation. We further discuss the reasons for this limitation, and suggest possible solutions to address it.",

It is true that out-of-band authentication using SMS messaging enhances the security of simple passwords specified by users, however many times the handling of the One-Time-Passwords (OTP) on the server side is done with disregard of the ways an attacker can bypass the requirement for such a feature. It is therefore essential to find ways which the OTP cannot be brute-forced or circumvented, by providing mechanisms such as automatic purging of OTPs from the database and enhancing the safety of the server traffic handling as well as the HTTP form submission requests and responses with a library known as Hash cash. By using this method, a potential attacker would be met by a time-consuming challenge, which would leave any sort of brute-force, denial of service or requirement circumvention attacks impractical for gaining access to a PHP login system. Furthermore, the usage of Hash cash for credential retransmission and re-authentication for vital aspects of the user's workflow while authenticated, make such as system much more impenetrable than using simple out-of-band or other two-factor authentication schemes.",

The technique is based on breaking concurrency in a way that enables the attack code to take over the synchronization established by target kernel modules. That level of control allows the attack code to interpose between those modules, and thus intercept sensitive data. We illustrate the overall technique as applied to intercepting keystrokes from a computer keyboard on Windows 7, and demonstrate it in practice through an attack kernel driver that we dubbed kbdinterceptor. The technique has no reliance on function hooking, machine code replacement, direct access to I/O bus, or attachment to any device driver stack whatsoever. In the paper, we capture the salient characteristics of the attack technique to devise a defensive approach that can accurately detect the corresponding attack code through dynamic analysis.",

Maintaining low network usage spikes and fast times during live migration are necessary goals to ensure that the performance of the migrating VM as well as that of other VMs in the cluster is not degraded. In this paper we present a proactive memory sharing protocol that utilizes the commonality of memory pages between VMs due to similar resident Operating Systems and applications to achieve these goals. The proposed method identifies and distributes important shared pages in a cluster over time substantially reducing network usage and enabling fast times during migration. We implement our approach on a test cluster and demonstrate the time and bandwidth benefits achieved with real world loads for both pre and post copy live migration.",

In this paper, traffic analysis in cell-edge is developed based on NCB policy using three dimension Markov model. The model is based on actual resources allocated to cell-edge users according to Soft Frequency Reuse (SFR) scheme in LTE-Advanced system. In the proposed model, the performance metrics in terms of blocking and dropping probability for cell-edge and cell-core users is deduced separately, in addition, the optimal parameter settings for system performance metrics is developed.",

At first, QR decomposition is applied to the channel matrix for getting an upper triangular matrix and has been achieved the required number of candidate constellation points around the maximum likelihood (ML) points without considering all possible candidate constellation set. Finally, the ratio of the diagonal elements of upper triangular matrix adaptively determines the number of candidates to reduce the further complexity of the searching process. However, the error performance of the proposed scheme is not very close to the ML detection, but the computational complexity can be reduced by 83% as compared to the very fast detection algorithm at a bit error rate (BER) 10 -- 4.",

In fact, cloud providers try to offer the necessary resources according to the users' demands giving the illusion of infinite resources. However, when these resources are insufficient to satisfy the users' requirements, conflicts may appear. Thus, it is compulsory to design a resource allocation mechanism that shares resources between cloud users in a fair manner. Moreover, security is considered as a blocking issue for the adoption of cloud computing. Misbehaving users may overload the shared resources leading to Denial of Service problem (DoS), data loss, etc. Therefore, our main goal in this paper is to guarantee efficient resource sharing with a high degree of fairness between cloud users while improving security for shared resources in cloud computing architectures. Thus, we target Dominant Resource Fairness (DRF) mechanism. Under DRF, no cloud user can gain an unfair advantage over another. Efficient and secure utilization of storage resources will be provided.",

To this end the performance of an Android based tablet computer is compared to that of a Notebook. Due to its prevalence within the scientific community and its availability on both platforms, Python is used as the basis of the comparison.The conclusion is that the basic tablet hardware platform compares well to that of the Notebook. The software also compares well in terms of usability and features but lacks performance where floating-point computations are concerned.The notebook-to-tablet ratio of performance varied from 3x for Int32 variables to 100x for float32 and float64. The slow floating-point computations were found not to be due to hardware limitations but most likely to be the result of incorrect compiler switches used when compiling the Python application for the tablet.",

In this paper, we propose an operation scenario model for energy harvesting embedded systems. The proposed model is defined as a set of operation points selected from periodical candidate points to execute the application. In order to ensure the stability of system operation, the application has to be executed at least once within a given maximum interval. In this work, an operation quality in the model is defined as execution frequency. We further propose an efficient algorithm to maximize the operation quality, i.e., To find a maximum set of operation points. The proposed algorithm selects as many execution points as possible while satisfying the constraints of the battery capacity and the system stability. We prove the optimality of proposed algorithm. Additionally, the experiments demonstrate that proposed algorithm can find one of the optimum solution quickly.",

The communication for TSQR based LS solver for multiple right hand sides is still optimal in the sense that no additional messages are necessary compared to TSQR.

The known solutions employ a variety of techniques, including combining (which works only for certain kinds of messages), feedback damping (which appears to provide low utilization in the absence of hot spots), and large numbers of buffers. In practice, the approach used today is to provide large numbers of buffers: in a P-processor system, the rule of thumb appears to be to provide 10P buffers, but 10P buffers maybe too expensive for systems containing 105 or more processors. Even employing Omega(P) buffers does not appear to provide any guarantees, however. We show that by organizing the switches so that the messages addressed to a particular processor can use only certain of the buffers, many hotspots can be tolerated with few buffers. For example, a switch with O(log P) buffers can tolerate a single hotspot with probability 1, and allows the first few hotspots to have a large number of buffers before being declared a hotspot. A switch with B buffers can be organized so that it blocks a particular non-hotspot message with probability less than O(1/s) if there are O(B/log s) hotspots, and can handle a factor of O(B (log log s)/log s) more hotspots before the probability becomes a constant. A similar approach can also be used to improve caching behavior in a multithreaded system in which one of the threads tries to consume all of the cache.",

The key idea of this paper is to extract the fault signature for each of the missing gate faults in a reversible circuit. Fault signatures are generated using the successive tree form of Multi-Input Signature Analyzer (MISA). Fault diagnosis is performed by verifying the signature of the circuit under test. The proposed method rapidly identifies the fault locations and the experimental results for benchmark circuits exhibit the efficiency of the technique.",

While the results are promising the memory overhead is high. Here we propose to reduce the memory usage by limiting the checkpoint depth based on an in-depth study of the memory and execution time effects. We also propose an adaptive heuristic to dynamically adjust the checkpoints. We evaluate this using 15 web applications on an 8-core computer. The results show that the memory overhead is reduced for Thread Level Speculation by over 90% as compared to storing all checkpoints. Further, the performance is often better than when storing all the checkpoints and at worst 4% slower.",

                    "abstract": "K-scope is a source code analysis tool with a graphical user interface for the performance tuning of Fortran programs. With K-scope, developers are able to visually understand the structures of their Fortran programs and estimate their performance. However, the original version of K-scope has two problems. First, it lacks the ability to integrate the results of source code analysis with performance profiling data. Second, it requires developers to install XcalableMP because K-scope utilizes the front-end of the XcalableMP compiler. However it is difficult to set up the XcalableMP environment because this requires installing and configuring several libraries and applications. A binary package of XcalableMP is only available for major Linux distributions, and developers thus have a hard time installing XcalableMP on other environments, e.g., Windows. In order to address these two problems, we extend K-scope with two mechanisms. The first visualizes performance profiling data and the second offloads the parsing of Fortran programs to a remote server. More specifically, the visualization mechanism enables users to readily identify performance bottlenecks in their programs by mapping performance profiling data to each line of the source code. With the offloading mechanism, developers no longer need to install XcalableMP. Instead, they can connect K-scope to a remote server on which XcalableMP is installed, and which generates the intermediate code used for analysis. For this purpose, we develop a tool named SSHconnect. To verify the effectiveness of our extended K-scope, we analyze the Nonhydrostatic Icosahedral Atmospheric Model (NICAM) code, an application for global climate simulation that consists of about 300,000 lines of Fortran code. We found that K-scope successfully identified performance bottlenecks in the NICAM code and translated the source code for several applications using its remote parsing mechanism.",

Recently, it is pointed out that Blocker Tag (BT), which is originally used to protect the privacy, jams RFID inventory management system and a BT detection scheme is proposed. The conventional BT detection scheme detects BT based on the anomaly of the observed number of collision slots. However, in the conventional scheme, a reader can detect BT neither accurately nor quickly since it has to observe at least one frame which consists of large slots. In this paper, we propose a deterministic BT detection by letting tags respond in the specified slots and comparing the expected and observed status of each slot. The response slot is determined by using a hash function, a random number, a frame length and tag's ID. This way enables the reader to predict the status of each slot. Our scheme immediately detects BT if the expected status is different from the observed status. Our scheme can also detect even though BT jams low-rate. Simulation results show that our scheme performs better than the conventional BT detections scheme in terms of the number of required slots to detect BT.",

The cloud computing paradigm offers new ways of storing data based on scalability and on good conditions of reliability and accessibility. This paper proposes the design of HPS3, a service that uses compression and concurrency techniques in order to reduce storage costs and data processing times in public storage providers. Different strategies for compressing and uploading data depending on differential characteristics of the datasets are also explained. The evaluation of HPS3 shows, in comparison with the default use of the cloud storage provider (Amazon S3), an average reduction of 61.6% in data transfer volume, 85.5% in upload time and 73.2% in incurred costs. Compared to Drop box, HPS3 shows an average improvement of 27.4% in data transfer volume and 93.6% in upload time.",

The framework is designed to handle explicit time-stepping methods over structured grids for the approximation of time-dependent PDEs. It provides an interface to gradient-based optimization algorithms like L-BFGS-B. Derivatives needed for the optimization are computed via algorithmic differentiation (AD) since this approach provides exact derivatives values with a reasonable computational overhead. Hence, the integration of the AD-tool ADOL-C has been a major design principle for the data management of SCADOPT. We describe the core components of SCADOPT, the employed parallelization methods, and the integration of ADOL-C. Furthermore, we illustrate the solution of an optimization problem based on the heat equation with SCADOPT in about 90 lines. To demonstrate the excellent performance of SCADOPT, we show the weak and strong scaling with respect to MPI on a modern HPC cluster.",

This system aims to provide a system which enables the doctors and the nurses to collaborate in the same working environment. This system has two major components: portable devices and medical service server. The key of medical service system is the continuous exchange and transfer of information between doctors and nurses. Doctors and nurses will provide the basic medical information through the portable devices. The medical service server collects the basic data and processes them. And then the server provides the analyzed medical information to doctors and nurses. And the DICOM images are converted to PNG images for the utilization on portable devices. The proposed system can provide a computer supported cooperative work mode to the users. This system has been demonstrated in the real application environment using portable devices with iOS and Android as the basic platform. The performance evaluation of this system is also experimented, which shows the size of medical images is reduced greatly and the efficiency improvement by this system and.",

When the frequency becomes higher than before, the consumed energy is also increased. Embedded systems are devices limited resource and most of them are powered by batteries. Power-consumption has been the main challenge of embedded systems. In this paper, a novel DVS algorithm based on utilization of time slices for embedded systems was proposed. A task model was established according to the characteristics of the tasks. The utilization of each task in the past time slices was calculated and recorded. And the expected utilization of each task was calculated based on the past utilization. The expected utilization was mapped to a proper frequency. And then the supply voltage of the processor would be scheduled dynamically according to the running task. When the supply voltage was adjusted downward, the power-consumption was also reduced. The experiments showed that this approach could reduce about 10% power-consumption for the tested devices.",

One of the challenges posed by cloud applications is Quality-of-Service (QoS) management. In the particular case of Apache CloudStack, Service Offerings are employed as the way to specify QoS levels, as they allow to define the characteristics of the Virtual Machines (VMs) running in the Compute Nodes (CNs) in the Cloud. However, the current implementation of the Apache CloudStack Agent cannot limit the CPU usage of the VMs accurately when the KVM hypervisor is used, presenting a high variability in the performance. This is due to the fact that the performance of the VM does not only depend on the Service Offering selected by the user but also depends on the Service Offerings of the VMs coexisting in the same CN, even if the node is not over-provisioned. Cloud users expect providers to deliver a fixed quality characteristics. If the VM characteristic fluctuate, depending on other VMs sharing the same hardware, it is going to be impossible for the user to determine the best cloud configuration to achieve her requirements. To overcome this situation, we have implemented a supervised Apache CloudStack Agent that can limit the CPU usage accurately, providing performance isolation to the user VM, so each user VM behaves exactly how it is specified in the Service Offerings. The behaviour of this new agent is analysed in this paper under several scenarios.",

Therefore, fault tolerance evolves into one of the most significant design objectives, especially for embedded systems working under extreme environments, such as space project. Techniques both in hardware and software are presented. Most of these techniques, however, either require extra resources (e.g. redundant component) or cause great performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a novel fault tolerant technique for Java Virtual Machine (JVM) called the warm-JVM rejuvenation, which can proactively correct soft errors. This approach periodically performs JVM rejuvenation during the execution of Java applications. The experiments show that our approach can improve the JVM reliability and maintain performance and response time.",

Unlike general nonlinear systems, the algebraic structure enables to compute all solutions of a polynomial system. We describe our massively parallel predictor-corrector algorithms to track many solution paths of a polynomial homotopy. The data parallelism that provides the speedups stems from the evaluation and differentiation of the monomials in the same polynomial system at different data points, which are the points on the solution paths. Polynomial homotopies that have tens of thousands of solution paths can keep a sufficiently large amount of threads occupied. Our accelerated code combines the reverse mode of algorithmic differentiation with double double and quad double arithmetic to compute more accurate results faster.",

Although their reconfigurability can enable significant fault tolerance, due to the complexity of execution time in their design flow, in-field reconfigurability can be infeasible and thus limit such potential. This need is addressed by developing a graph and set theoretic approach, named hypergraph-cover diversity (HCD), as a preemptive design technique to shift the dominant costs of resiliency to design-time. In particular, union-free hypergraphs are exploited to partition the reconfigurable resources pool into highly separable subsets of resources, each of which can be utilized by the same synthesized application netlist. The diverse implementations provide reconfiguration-based resilience throughout the system lifetime while avoiding the significant overheads associated with runtime placement and routing phases. Two novel scalable algorithms to construct union-free hypergraphs are proposed and described. Evaluation on a Motion-JPEG image compression core using a Xilinx 7-series-based FPGA hardware platform demonstrates a statistically significant increase in fault tolerance and area efficiency when using proposed work compared to commonly-used modular redundancy approaches.",

In series production fail-safe systems as well as fault-tolerant systems are realized with redundant hardware concepts like dual core microcontrollers running in lock-step-mode to reach highest safety requirements given by standards, like ISO 26262 or IEC 61508. In contrast to the hardware redundancy approach, there are also approaches available with information-, time-and/or software-redundancy since several years. One of them is known as coded processing or AN-codes. Coded processing is capable of reducing redundancy in hardware by adding diverse redundancy in software. But the breakthrough of coded processing never took place. One reason for this seem to be the myths which are widely propagated on this subject and the hereby associated uncertainties. In this paper some myths are busted, like the usage of prime numbers as transformation factor A, the myth that greater transformation factors are better or the myth about the residual error probability defined as 1/A. Some of them have been propagated since 1989. The aim of this paper is to provide more clarity and understanding for this technique, perhaps to pave the way for further functional safety concepts based on coded processing approaches.",

The tasks are mapped to the cores on the chip. They have communication requirements according to their relationship. When the communication data are transmitted on the network, they need to be given a suitable path to the target cores with low latency. In this paper, we proposed a new routing method based on static critical path for NOC. The tasks with multi-threads will be analyzed first and the running paths of the tasks will be marked. The static critical path can be found according to the length of the running paths. The messages on critical path will be marked as critical messages. When the messages have arrived at the routers on chip, the critical messages will be forwarded firstly in terms of their importance. This new routing method has been tested on simulation environment. The experiment results proved that this method can accelerate the transmission speed of critical messages and improve the performance of the tasks.",

The computation of betweenness centrality is based on shortest paths which requires O(n+m) space and O(mn) and O(nm+n2 log n) time on unweighted and weighted graphs, respectively. It is time-consuming to deal with large-scale graphs, which motivates us resort to distributed computing and parallel algorithms. In this paper, we design a vertex-based parallel algorithm following the shortest path approach (SPBC). Moreover, we propose a distributed algorithm based on message propagation(MPBC) to quantify the importance of vertices. MPBC takes into account the real situation of information diffusion in social networks. We implement our algorithms on Graphlab and evaluate them through comprehensive experiments. The results show that both SPBC and MPBC scale well with the increasing number of machines. SPBC on 2 machines outperforms the classical centralized algorithm by 1.59 times in terms of running time. MPBC can handle graph with ten millions of vertices and edges within an acceptable time where classical algorithms become infeasible.",

Some of them are focused on specific research field, or they are enterprise grade solutions. In order to overcome this situation and to provide system administrators and users the possibility of deploying specific Virtual Clusters on demand in Cloud, we have developed a new tool called Flexible Cluster Manager (FCM). It allows user selectable cluster configuration packages, and it is very easy to include more software by means of the definition of the deployment workflow. FCM allows changing the software configuration of the deployed cluster on-line, including the support of fixing damaged virtual clusters, i.e clusters that have damaged or missing nodes. The performance of our tool, using commodity hardware, is also presented using serial and parallel deploying of the virtual cluster.",

Then a case study of shell-and-tube reactor for a single shell and several reaction tubes pass reactor with a variable number of baffles and turbulent flow is performed. The results are observed to be sensitive to the turbulence model selection. The best turbulence model among the ones considered is determined by comparing the CFD results of heat transfer coefficient, outlet temperature and pressure drop with the Bell -- CDelaware method results. For two baffle cut values, the effect of the baffle spacing to shell diameter ratio on the heat exchanger performance is investigated by varying flow rate. The temperature distribution of the reaction tube is influenced by thermal environment of both shell and tube side, and optimizing the fluid flow in shell side to conform to the exothermic characteristics of the reaction tube can effectively improve the temperature uniformity of the reaction tubes.",

Non-uniform traffic behaviors of networks that have random spikes, long tails make difficulties to detect and analyze traffic. In this paper, we present a Mixture of Lognormal Distribution Model (MLDM) based Quality of Service (QoS) evaluation technique that determines unobservable hidden traffic behaviors of networks using observable traffic data, and QoS parameters, their evaluation by traffic zones using incoming Key Parameter Identifications (KPIs). The posterior parameters of MLDM is estimated using the Bayesian probability method, and Lagrangian Multiplier techniques. The zoned traffic results illustrate that the developed approach can help to determine QoS parameters by traffic zones in networks. For the approach, we deal with two algorithms of the approach that can work together for the advanced approach using traffic data of Public Safety Network (PSN).",

Threads arrive at barrier ahead of other threads have to wait the subsequent threads. This lead to some waste of time. Our experiments show that up to 35% of the total execution time is wasted on synchronization. Inspired by this, we propose barrier speculation which allows faster threads running speculatively with its own temporary data instead of waiting at barrier for synchronization. To control the max number barriers that threads can speculatively pass through, we also propose two risk control strategies: waiting in place risk control strategy and roll back re-speculate risk control strategy. Our evaluation results show that our barrier speculation together with two risk control strategies can achieve 5.7% and 6.3% overall program execution time reduction on average respectively when compared with conventional synchronization.",

Unfortunately, the existing concurrent deques have two limitations. Firstly, these algorithms require memory fences in the owner's critical path operations to ensure correctness, which is expensive in modern weak-memory architectures. Secondly, the concurrent deques are difficult to extend to support various flexible forms of task distribution strategies, which can be more sufficient to optimize computation in some special applications, such as steal-half strategy in solving large, irregular graph problems. This paper proposes a blocking work-stealing deque. We optimize work stealing task deques through effective ways of accessing the deques to decrease the synchronization overhead. These ways can reduce the frequency of races when different threads need to operate on the same deque, especially using massive threads. We present implementation of the algorithm as a C++ library and the experiment results show that it behaves well to Cilk plus on a series of benchmarks. Since our approach relies on blocking deques, it is easy to extend to support flexible task creation and distribution strategies and also reduces the memory fences impact on performance.",

However, over the past several decades, the storage primitives that access secondary storage have remained unchanged, forcing NAND flash memory to serve merely as a block device like hard disk drive. Recently, several emerging storage primitives have been presented to explore the potential value of non-volatile memory devices. They provide high-level virtual address to logical address mapping and allow the applications to directly manipulate I/O operations. Although these primitives can significantly boost the access performance by providing virtual to logical address mappings, they still need to handle the logical to physical address translations in current flash-based storage systems and require further support for update operations. This paper presents ESP to optimize Emerging Storage Primitives with virtualization for flash memory storage systems. We propose an optimization strategy, namely virtual duplication, to solve the critical issues in existing emerging storage primitives. The objective is to reduce unnecessary flash memory accesses and improve the address translation for emerging stroage primitives. We have evaluated ESP on an embedded development platform. Experimental result show that ESP can improve the write/read performance by 56.71% and reduce over 30% of garbage collection operations.",
